            "Description": "\nThis package contains BFD and opcodes static and dynamic libraries.\n\nThe dynamic libraries are in this package, rather than a seperate\nbase package because they are actually linker scripts that force\nthe use of the static libraries.  This is because the API of the\nBFD library is too unstable to be used dynamically.\n\nThe static libraries are here because they are now needed by the\ndynamic libraries.\n\nDevelopers starting new projects are strongly encouraged to consider\nusing libelf instead of BFD.\n",
