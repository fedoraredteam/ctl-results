            "Description": "\nThe Byte Code Engineering Library (formerly known as JavaClass) is\nintended to give users a convenient possibility to analyze, create, and\nmanipulate (binary) Java class files (those ending with .class). Classes\nare represented by objects which contain all the symbolic information of\nthe given class: methods, fields and byte code instructions, in\nparticular.  Such objects can be read from an existing file, be\ntransformed by a program (e.g. a class loader at run-time) and dumped to\na file again. An even more interesting application is the creation of\nclasses from scratch at run-time. The Byte Code Engineering Library\n(BCEL) may be also useful if you want to learn about the Java Virtual\nMachine (JVM) and the format of Java .class files.  BCEL is already\nbeing used successfully in several projects such as compilers,\noptimizers, obsfuscators and analysis tools, the most popular probably\nbeing the Xalan XSLT processor at Apache.\n",
