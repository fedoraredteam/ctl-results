So if you wish to build\nthe ability to communicate directly with ibacm into your own application,\nthe protocol used to communicate with it, and the data structures\ninvolved, are in this header file.  Please note that this is an unsupported\nmethod of using this daemon.  The only supported means of using this is\nvia librdmacm.  As such, even though this header file is provided, no\nfurther documentation is available.  One must read the source if they\nwish to make use of this header file.\n",
