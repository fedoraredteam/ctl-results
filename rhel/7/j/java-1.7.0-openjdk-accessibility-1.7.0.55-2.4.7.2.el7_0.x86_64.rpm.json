This allows compatible at-spi2 based accessibility programs to work for AWT and Swing-based programs.\nPlease note, the java-atk-wrapper is still in beta, and also OpenJDK itself is still in phase of tuning to be working with accessibility features.\nAlthough working pretty fine, there are known issues with accessibility on, so do not rather install this package unless you really need.\n",
