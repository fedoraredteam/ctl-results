It is also a rewrite of the\nvery useful tool JLex which was developed by Elliot Berk at Princeton\nUniversity.  As Vern Paxson states for his C/C++ tool flex: They do\nnot share any code though.  JFlex is designed to work together with\nthe LALR parser generator CUP by Scott Hudson, and the Java\nmodification of Berkeley Yacc BYacc/J by Bob Jamison.  It can also be\nused together with other parser generators like ANTLR or as a\nstandalone tool.\n",
