The API also permits changing or removing\nsubroutine calls from the application program. Run-time code changes are\nuseful to support a variety of applications including debugging, performance\nmonitoring, and to support composing applications out of existing packages.\nThe goal of this API is to provide a machine independent interface to permit\nthe creation of tools and applications that use run-time code patching.\n",
