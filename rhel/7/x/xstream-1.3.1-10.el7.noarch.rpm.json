            "Description": "\nXStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML\nand back again. A high level facade is supplied that\nsimplifies common use cases. Custom objects can be serialized\nwithout need for specifying mappings. Speed and low memory\nfootprint are a crucial part of the design, making it suitable\nfor large object graphs or systems with high message throughput.\nNo information is duplicated that can be obtained via reflection.\nThis results in XML that is easier to read for humans and more\ncompact than native Java serialization. XStream serializes internal\nfields, including private and final. Supports non-public and inner\nclasses. Classes are not required to have default constructor.\nDuplicate references encountered in the object-model will be\nmaintained. Supports circular references. By implementing an\ninterface, XStream can serialize directly to/from any tree\nstructure (not just XML). Strategies can be registered allowing\ncustomization of how particular types are represented as XML.\nWhen an exception occurs due to malformed XML, detailed diagnostics\nare provided to help isolate and fix the problem.\n",
