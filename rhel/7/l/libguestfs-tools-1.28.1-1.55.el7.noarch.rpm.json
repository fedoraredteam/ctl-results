Unlike other tools, it doesn\u2019t just display the\namount of space allocated to a virtual machine, but can look inside\nthe virtual machine to see how much space is really being used.  It is\nlike the df(1) command, but for virtual machines, except that it also\nworks for Windows virtual machines.\n\nVirt-diff shows the differences between virtual machines.\n\nVirt-edit is a command line tool to edit the contents of a file in a\nvirtual machine.\n\nVirt-filesystems is a command line tool to display the filesystems,\npartitions, block devices, LVs, VGs and PVs found in a disk image\nor virtual machine.\n\nVirt-format is a command line tool to erase and make blank disks.\n\nVirt-inspector examines a virtual machine and tries to determine the\nversion of the OS, the kernel version, what drivers are installed,\nwhether the virtual machine is fully virtualized (FV) or\npara-virtualized (PV), what applications are installed and more.\n\nVirt-log is a command line tool to display the log files from a\nvirtual machine.\n\nVirt-ls is a command line tool to list out files in a virtual machine.\n\nVirt-make-fs is a command line tool to build a filesystem out of\na collection of files or a tarball.\n\nVirt-rescue provides a rescue shell for making interactive,\nunstructured fixes to virtual machines.\n\nVirt-resize can resize existing virtual machine disk images.\n\nVirt-sparsify makes virtual machine disk images sparse (thin-provisioned).\n\nVirt-sysprep lets you reset or unconfigure virtual machines in\npreparation for cloning them.\n\nVirt-tar-in and virt-tar-out are archive, backup and upload tools\nfor virtual machines.\n\nVirt-win-reg lets you look at and modify the Windows Registry of\nWindows virtual machines.\n",
