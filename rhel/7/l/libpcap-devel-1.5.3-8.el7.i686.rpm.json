Since almost every system\nvendor provides a different interface for packet capture, the libpcap\nauthors created this system-independent API to ease in porting and to\nalleviate the need for several system-dependent packet capture modules\nin each application.\n\nThis package provides the libraries, include files, and other\nresources needed for developing libpcap applications.\n",
