            "Description": "\nContains runtime shared libraries for libgsm, an implementation of\nthe European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for full-rate speech\ntranscoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP (residual pulse\nexcitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.\n\nGSM 06.10 compresses frames of 162 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling\nrate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility\nwith typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160\n16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).\nThe quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker\nrecognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable\nform (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).\n\nThe interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and\na library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime\non most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the\nETSI standard test patterns.\n",
