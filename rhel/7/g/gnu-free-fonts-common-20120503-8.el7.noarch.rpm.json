It is Unicode-encoded for\ncompatibility with all modern operating systems.\n\nBesides a full set of characters for writing systems based on the Latin\nalphabet, FreeFont contains large selection of characters from other writing\nsystems some of which are hard to find elsewhere.\n\nFreeFont also contains a large set of symbol characters, both technical and\ndecorative. We are especially pleased with the Mathematical Operators range,\nwith which most of the glyphs used in LaTeX can be displayed.\n\nThis package consists of files used by other gnu-free-fonts packages.\n",
