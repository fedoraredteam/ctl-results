It aggregates various storage bricks over Infiniband RDMA\nor TCP/IP interconnect into one large parallel network file\nsystem. GlusterFS is one of the most sophisticated file systems in\nterms of features and extensibility.  It borrows a powerful concept\ncalled Translators from GNU Hurd kernel. Much of the code in GlusterFS\nis in user space and easily manageable.\n\nThis package includes the glusterfs binary, the glusterfsd daemon and the\nlibglusterfs and glusterfs translator modules common to both GlusterFS server\nand client framework.\n",
