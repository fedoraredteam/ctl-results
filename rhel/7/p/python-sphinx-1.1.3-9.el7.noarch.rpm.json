            "Description": "\nSphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and\nbeautiful documentation for Python projects (or other documents\nconsisting of multiple reStructuredText sources), written by Georg\nBrandl. It was originally created to translate the new Python\ndocumentation, but has now been cleaned up in the hope that it will be\nuseful to many other projects.\n\nSphinx uses reStructuredText as its markup language, and many of its\nstrengths come from the power and straightforwardness of\nreStructuredText and its parsing and translating suite, the Docutils.\n\nAlthough it is still under constant development, the following\nfeatures are already present, work fine and can be seen \"in action\" in\nthe Python docs:\n\n    * Output formats: HTML (including Windows HTML Help) and LaTeX,\n      for printable PDF versions\n    * Extensive cross-references: semantic markup and automatic links\n      for functions, classes, glossary terms and similar pieces of\n      information\n    * Hierarchical structure: easy definition of a document tree, with\n      automatic links to siblings, parents and children\n    * Automatic indices: general index as well as a module index\n    * Code handling: automatic highlighting using the Pygments highlighter\n    * Various extensions are available, e.g. for automatic testing of\n      snippets and inclusion of appropriately formatted docstrings.\n",
