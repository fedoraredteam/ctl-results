            "Description": "\nThe Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Manager is an optional PKI\nsubsystem that can act as a stand-alone OCSP service.  The OCSP Manager\nperforms the task of an online certificate validation authority by enabling\nOCSP-compliant clients to do real-time verification of certificates.  Note\nthat an online certificate-validation authority is often referred to as an\nOCSP Responder.\n\nAlthough the Certificate Authority (CA) is already configured with an\ninternal OCSP service.  An external OCSP Responder is offered as a separate\nsubsystem in case the user wants the OCSP service provided outside of a\nfirewall while the CA resides inside of a firewall, or to take the load of\nrequests off of the CA.\n\nThe OCSP Manager can receive Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) from\nmultiple CA servers, and clients can query the OCSP Manager for the\nrevocation status of certificates issued by all of these CA servers.\n\nWhen an instance of OCSP Manager is set up with an instance of CA, and\npublishing is set up to this OCSP Manager, CRLs are published to it\nwhenever they are issued or updated.\n\nThis package is one of the top-level java-based Tomcat PKI subsystems\nprovided by the PKI Core used by the Certificate System.\n\n\n==================================\n||  ABOUT \"CERTIFICATE SYSTEM\"  ||\n==================================\n\nCertificate System (CS) is an enterprise software system designed\nto manage enterprise Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) deployments.\n\nPKI Core contains ALL top-level java-based Tomcat PKI components:\n\n  * pki-symkey\n  * pki-base\n  * pki-tools\n  * pki-server\n  * pki-ca\n  * pki-kra\n  * pki-ocsp\n  * pki-tks\n  * pki-tps-tomcat\n  * pki-javadoc\n\nwhich comprise the following corresponding PKI subsystems:\n\n  * Certificate Authority (CA)\n  * Data Recovery Manager (DRM)\n  * Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Manager\n  * Token Key Service (TKS)\n  * Token Processing Service (TPS)\n\nFor deployment purposes, PKI Core contains fundamental packages\nrequired by BOTH native-based Apache AND java-based Tomcat\nCertificate System instances consisting of the following components:\n\n  * pki-tools\n\nAdditionally, PKI Core contains the following fundamental packages\nrequired ONLY by ALL java-based Tomcat Certificate System instances:\n\n  * pki-symkey\n  * pki-base\n  * pki-tools\n  * pki-server\n\nPKI Core also includes the following components:\n\n  * pki-javadoc\n\nFinally, if Certificate System is being deployed as an individual or\nset of standalone rather than embedded server(s)/service(s), it is\nstrongly recommended (though not explicitly required) to include at\nleast one PKI Theme package:\n\n  * dogtag-pki-theme (Dogtag Certificate System deployments)\n    * dogtag-pki-server-theme\n  * redhat-pki-server-theme (Red Hat Certificate System deployments)\n    * redhat-pki-server-theme\n  * customized pki theme (Customized Certificate System deployments)\n    * <customized>-pki-server-theme\n\n  NOTE:  As a convenience for standalone deployments, top-level meta\n         packages may be provided which bind a particular theme to\n         these certificate server packages.\n",
