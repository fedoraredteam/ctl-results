            "Description": "\nThe Token Processing System (TPS) is an optional PKI subsystem that acts\nas a Registration Authority (RA) for authenticating and processing\nenrollment requests, PIN reset requests, and formatting requests from\nthe Enterprise Security Client (ESC).\n\nTPS is designed to communicate with tokens that conform to\nGlobal Platform's Open Platform Specification.\n\nTPS communicates over SSL with various PKI backend subsystems (including\nthe Certificate Authority (CA), the Data Recovery Manager (DRM), and the\nToken Key Service (TKS)) to fulfill the user's requests.\n\nTPS also interacts with the token database, an LDAP server that stores\ninformation about individual tokens.\n\n\n==================================\n||  ABOUT \"CERTIFICATE SYSTEM\"  ||\n==================================\n\nCertificate System (CS) is an enterprise software system designed\nto manage enterprise Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) deployments.\n\nPKI Core contains ALL top-level java-based Tomcat PKI components:\n\n  * pki-symkey\n  * pki-base\n  * pki-tools\n  * pki-server\n  * pki-ca\n  * pki-kra\n  * pki-ocsp\n  * pki-tks\n  * pki-tps-tomcat\n  * pki-javadoc\n\nwhich comprise the following corresponding PKI subsystems:\n\n  * Certificate Authority (CA)\n  * Data Recovery Manager (DRM)\n  * Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Manager\n  * Token Key Service (TKS)\n  * Token Processing Service (TPS)\n\nFor deployment purposes, PKI Core contains fundamental packages\nrequired by BOTH native-based Apache AND java-based Tomcat\nCertificate System instances consisting of the following components:\n\n  * pki-tools\n\nAdditionally, PKI Core contains the following fundamental packages\nrequired ONLY by ALL java-based Tomcat Certificate System instances:\n\n  * pki-symkey\n  * pki-base\n  * pki-tools\n  * pki-server\n\nPKI Core also includes the following components:\n\n  * pki-javadoc\n\nFinally, if Certificate System is being deployed as an individual or\nset of standalone rather than embedded server(s)/service(s), it is\nstrongly recommended (though not explicitly required) to include at\nleast one PKI Theme package:\n\n  * dogtag-pki-theme (Dogtag Certificate System deployments)\n    * dogtag-pki-server-theme\n  * redhat-pki-server-theme (Red Hat Certificate System deployments)\n    * redhat-pki-server-theme\n  * customized pki theme (Customized Certificate System deployments)\n    * <customized>-pki-server-theme\n\n  NOTE:  As a convenience for standalone deployments, top-level meta\n         packages may be provided which bind a particular theme to\n         these certificate server packages.\n",
