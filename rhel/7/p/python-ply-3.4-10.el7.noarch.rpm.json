            "Description": "\nPLY is a straightforward lex/yacc implementation. Here is a list of its\nessential features:\n* It is implemented entirely in Python.\n* It uses LR-parsing which is reasonably efficient and well suited for larger\n  grammars.\n* PLY provides most of the standard lex/yacc features including support\n  for empty productions, precedence rules, error recovery, and support\n  for ambiguous grammars.\n* PLY is straightforward to use and provides very extensive error checking.\n* PLY doesn't try to do anything more or less than provide the basic lex/yacc\n  functionality. In other words, it's not a large parsing framework or a\n  component of some larger system.\n",
