            "Description": "\nCogl is a small open source library for using 3D graphics hardware to draw\npretty pictures. The API departs from the flat state machine style of\nOpenGL and is designed to make it easy to write orthogonal components that\ncan render without stepping on each others toes.\n\nAs well aiming for a nice API, we think having a single library as opposed\nto an API specification like OpenGL has a few advantages too; like being\nable to paper over the inconsistencies/bugs of different OpenGL\nimplementations in a centralized place, not to mention the myriad of OpenGL\nextensions. It also means we are in a better position to provide utility\nAPIs that help software developers since they only need to be implemented\nonce and there is no risk of inconsistency between implementations.\n\nHaving other backends, besides OpenGL, such as drm, Gallium or D3D are\noptions we are interested in for the future.\n",
