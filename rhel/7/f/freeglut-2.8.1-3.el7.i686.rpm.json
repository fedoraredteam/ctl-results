GLUT was originally\nwritten by Mark Kilgard to support the sample programs in the second edition\nOpenGL 'RedBook'. Since then, GLUT has been used in a wide variety of practical\napplications because it is simple, universally available and highly portable.\n\nfreeglut allows the user to create and manage windows containing OpenGL\ncontexts on a wide range of platforms and also read the mouse, keyboard and\njoystick functions.\n",
