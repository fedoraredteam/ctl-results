            "Description": "\nThe commons-logging package provides a simple, component oriented\ninterface (org.apache.commons.logging.Log) together with wrappers for\nlogging systems. The user can choose at runtime which system they want\nto use. In addition, a small number of basic implementations are\nprovided to allow users to use the package standalone.\ncommons-logging was heavily influenced by Avalon's Logkit and Log4J. The\ncommons-logging abstraction is meant to minimize the differences between\nthe two, and to allow a developer to not tie himself to a particular\nlogging implementation.\n",
