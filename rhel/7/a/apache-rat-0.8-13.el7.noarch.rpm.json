It will produce false positives and cannot find every possible\nissue with a release. It's reports require interpretation.\n\nRAT was developed in response to a need felt in the Apache Incubator to be\nable to review releases for the most common faults less labor intensively.\nIt is therefore highly tuned to the Apache style of releases.\n\nThis package just contains meta-data, you will want either apache-rat-tasks,\nor apache-rat-plugin.\n",
