Essentially it exposes the internals of applications for\nautomation, so tools such as screen readers, magnifiers, or even\nscripting interfaces can query and interact with GUI controls.\n\nThis version of at-spi is a major break from previous versions.\nIt has been completely rewritten to use D-Bus rather than\nORBIT / CORBA for its transport protocol.\n\nThis package includes a gtk-module that bridges ATK to the new\nD-Bus based at-spi.\n",
