            "Description": "\nThe introduction of the Collections API by Sun in JDK 1.2 has been a\nboon to quick and effective Java programming. Ready access to powerful\ndata structures has accelerated development by reducing the need for\ncustom container classes around each core object. Most Java2 APIs are\nsignificantly easier to use because of the Collections API.\nHowever, there are certain holes left unfilled by Sun's\nimplementations, and the Jakarta-Commons Collections Component strives\nto fulfill them. Among the features of this package are:\n- special-purpose implementations of Lists and Maps for fast access\n- adapter classes from Java1-style containers (arrays, enumerations) to\nJava2-style collections.\n- methods to test or create typical set-theory properties of collections\nsuch as union, intersection, and closure.\n",
