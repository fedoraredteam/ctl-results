            "Description": "\nThe Wen Quan Yi Unibit is designed as a dual-width (16x16,16x8)\nbitmap font to provide the most complete international symbol\ncoverage, serving as the system-wide fall-back font. This font\nhas covered over 46000 Unicode code points in BMP.\nIt is intended to supersede the outdated GNU Unifont.\nThis font was created by merging the latest update of GNU\nUnifont [GPL] (by Roman Czyborra and David Starner et al., the\nfont was last updated in 2004), WenQuanYi Bitmap Song [GPL]\n0.8.1 (by Qianqian Fang and WenQuanYi contributors) and\nFixed-16x8 [public domain] bitmap fonts from X11 core fonts.\nThe entire CJK Unified Ideographics (U4E00-U9FA5) and CJK Unified\nIdeographics Extension A(U3400-U4DB5) blocks were replaced by\nhigh-quality glyphs from China National Standard GB19966-2005\n(public domain). Near a thousand of non-CJK characters were improved by\nWenQuanYi contributors via their collaborative font editing website at\nhttp://wenq.org/eindex.cgi?Unicode_Chart_EN\n",
