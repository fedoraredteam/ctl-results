            "Description": "\nThe memoir class is for typesetting poetry, fiction, non-\nfiction, and mathematical works. Permissible document 'base'\nfont sizes range from 9 to 60pt. There is a range of page-\nstyles and well over a dozen chapter-styles to choose from, as\nwell as methods for specifying your own layouts and designs.\nThe class also provides the functionality of over thirty of the\nmore popular packages, thus simplifying document sources. The\nclass automatically loads an associated patch file mempatch;\nthe patch file may be updated from time to time, between\nreleases of the class itself. (The patch file stays around even\nwhen there are no extant patches.) Users who wish to use the\nhyperref package, in a document written with the memoir class,\nshould also use the memhfixc package (part of this bundle).\nNote, however, that current versions of hyperref actually load\nthe package automatically if they detect that they are running\nunder memoir.\n\ndate: 2011-03-06 22:53:00 +0100\n",
