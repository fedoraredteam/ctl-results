            "Description": "\nBibTeX allows the user to store his citation data in generic\nform, while printing citations in a document in the form\nspecified by a BibTeX style, to be specified in the document\nitself (one often needs a LaTeX citation-style package, such as\nnatbib as well). BibTeX itself is an ASCII-only program; there\nis, however, a version that copes with 8-bit character sets.\nHowever, BibTeX's facilities rapidly run out as one moves away\nfrom simple ASCII (for example, in the various national sorting\nrules for languages expressed in different parts of ISO-8859 --\nthe \"ISO Latin\" series). For more flexibility, the user is\nurged to consider using biber with biblatex to typeset its\noutput. In particular, it is best to avoid BibTeX in favour of\nbiblatex, if at all possible.\n\ndate: 2011-12-28 13:17:09 +0100\n",
