            "Description": "\nThe FPL Fonts provide a set of SC/OsF fonts for URW Palladio L\nwhich are compatible with respect to metrics with the Palatino\nSC/OsF fonts from Adobe. Note that it is not my aim to exactly\nreproduce the outlines of the original Adobe fonts. The SC and\nOsF in the FPL Fonts were designed with the glyphs from URW\nPalladio L as starting point. For some glyphs (e.g. 'o') I got\nthe best result by scaling and boldening. For others (e.g. 'h')\nshifting selected portions of the character gave more\nsatisfying results. All this was done using the free font\neditor FontForge. The kerning data in these fonts comes from\nWalter Schmidt's improved Palatino metrics. LaTeX use is\nenabled by the mathpazo package, which is part of the psnfss\ndistribution.\n\ndate: 2007-09-28 22:20:10 +0200\n",
