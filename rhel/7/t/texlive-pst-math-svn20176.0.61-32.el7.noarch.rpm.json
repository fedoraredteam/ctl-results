Pst-math\nprovides all those operators in a header file pst-math.pro with\nwrappers pst-math.sty and pst-math.tex. In addition, sinc,\ngauss, gammaln and bessel are implemented (only partially for\nthe latter). pst-math is designed essentially to work with pst-\nplot but can be used in whatever PS code (such as pstricks\nSpecialCoor \"!\", which is useful for placing labels). The\npackage also provides a routine SIMPSON for numerical\nintegration and a solver of linear equation systems.\n\ndate: 2010-10-02 23:46:37 +0200\n",
