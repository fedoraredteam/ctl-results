A document may select a single language to be\nsupported, or it may select several, in which case the document\nmay switch from one language to another in a variety of ways.\nNote that the package has contributions for several languages\nthat remain to be incorporated. Examples are: Arabic; Magyar\n(Hungarian); Serbian written in cyrillic; Spanish; and Spanish,\nusing Mexican conventions.. Users of XeTeX are advised to use\npolyglossia rather than Babel.\n\ndate: 2011-10-07 15:38:55 +0200\n",
