            "Description": "\nThe l3experimental packages are a collection of experimental\nimplementations for aspects of the LaTeX3 kernel, dealing with\nhigher-level ideas such as the Designer Interface. Some of them\nwork as stand alone packages, providing new functionality, and\ncan be used on top of LaTeX2e with no changes to the existing\nkernel. The present release includes: - xgalley, which controls\nboxes receiving text for typesetting. - l3dt: kernel support\nfor data tables; - l3galley: kernel support for xgalley; -\nl3regex: kernel support for regular expression search and\nreplace operations; - l3sort: kernel support for sorting\nsequences, token lists or comma-lists, according to user-\nspecified comparison criteria; - l3str: kernel support for\nstring manipulation; - l3tl-build: kernel support for token\nlist building; - l3tl_analysis: kernel support for token list\nanalysis; and - xcoffins, which allows the alignment of boxes\nusing a series of 'handle' positions, supplementing the simple\nTeX reference point. All the files of the bundle are also\navailable in the Subversion (SVN) repository of the LaTeX3\nProject. The bundle on CTAN is based on a snapshot of the SVN\nrepository on 2012-11-21.\n\ndate: 2013-03-12 10:55:10 +0100\n",
