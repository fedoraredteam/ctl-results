            "Description": "\nThe Pazo Math fonts are a family of PostScript fonts suitable\nfor typesetting mathematics in combination with the Palatino\nfamily of text fonts. The Pazo Math family is made up of five\nfonts provided in Adobe Type 1 format (PazoMath, PazoMath-\nItalic, PazoMath-Bold, PazoMath-BoldItalic, and\nPazoMathBlackboardBold). These contain, in designs that match\nPalatino, glyphs that are usually not available in Palatino and\nfor which Computer Modern looks odd when combined with\nPalatino. These glyphs include the uppercase Greek alphabet in\nupright and slanted shapes in regular and bold weights, the\nlowercase Greek alphabet in slanted shape in regular and bold\nweights, several mathematical glyphs (partialdiff, summation,\nproduct, coproduct, emptyset, infinity, and proportional) in\nregular and bold weights, other glyphs (Euro and dotlessj) in\nupright and slanted shapes in regular and bold weights, and the\nuppercase letters commonly used to represent various number\nsets (C, I, N, Q, R, and Z) in blackboard bold. The set also\nincludes a set of 'true' small-caps fonts, also suitable for\nuse with Palatino (or one of its clones). LaTeX macro support\n(using package mathpazo.sty) is provided in psnfss (a required\npart of any LaTeX distribution).\n\ndate: 2009-10-06 20:42:53 +0200\n",
