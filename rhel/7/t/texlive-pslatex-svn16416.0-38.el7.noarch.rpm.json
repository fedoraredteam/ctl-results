            "Description": "\nA small package that makes LaTeX default to 'standard'\nPostScript fonts. It is basically a merger of the times and the\n(obsolete) mathptm packages from the psnfss suite. You must\nhave installed standard LaTeX and the psnfss PostScript fonts\nto use this package. The main novel feature is that the pslatex\npackage tries to compensate for the visual differences between\nthe Adobe fonts by scaling Helvetica by 90%, and 'condensing'\nCourier (i.e. scaling horizontally) by 85%. The package is\nsupplied with a (unix) shell file for a 'pslatex' command that\nallows standard LaTeX documents to be processed, without\nneeding to edit the file. Note that current psnfss uses a\ndifferent technique for scaling Helvetica, and treats Courier\nas a lost cause (there are better free fixed-width available\nnow, than there were when pslatex was designed). As a result,\npslatex is widely considered obsolete.\n\ndate: 2009-10-07 22:25:55 +0200\n",
