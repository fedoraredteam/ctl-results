            "Description": "\nThe package provides support for the manipulation and reference\nof small or 'sub' figures and tables within a single figure or\ntable environment. It is convenient to use this package when\nyour subfigures are to be separately captioned, referenced, or\nare to be included in the List-of-Figures. A new \\subfigure\ncommand is introduced which can be used inside a figure\nenvironment for each subfigure. An optional first argument is\nused as the caption for that subfigure. This package supersedes\nthe subfigure package (which will continue to be supported, but\nno longer maintained). The name has changed because the subfig\npackage is not completely backward compatible with the older\nsubfigure package due to an extensive rewrite to use the new\ncaption package to produce its subcaptions. The major advantage\nto the new package is that the user interface is keyword/value\ndriven and easier to use. To ease the transition from the\nsubfigure package it includes a configuration file (subfig.cfg)\nwhich nearly emulates the subfigure package.\n\ndate: 2010-05-10 00:41:23 +0200\n",
