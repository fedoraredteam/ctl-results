            "Description": "\nThe beamer LaTeX class can be used for producing slides. Its\nfunctionality is similar to Prosper but does not need any\nexternal programs and can directly produce a presentation using\npdflatex. Beamer uses pgf for pdf/ps independent graphics.\nFrames are created using \\frame{...}, and a frame can build\nmultiple slides through a simple notation for specifying\nmaterial for each slide within a frame. Beamer supports\nbibliographies, appendicies and transitions. Short versions of\ntitle, authors, institute can also be specified as optional\nparameters. A \\plainframe{} allows a picture, for example, to\nfill the whole frame. Support figure and table environments,\ntransparency effects, a \\transduration command, animation\ncommands, a pauses environment. Beamer also provides\ncompatibility with other packages like prosper. The package now\nincorporates the functionality of the former translator\npackage, which is used for customising the package for use in\nother language environments.\n\ndate: 2013-01-04 23:53:30 +0100\n",
