It is a development of Leslie Lamport's original\nLaTeX 2.09, and superseded the older system in June 1994. The\nbasic distribution is catalogued separately, at latex-base;\napart from a large set of contributed packages and third-party\ndocumentation (elsewhere on the archive), the distribution\nincludes: - a bunch of required packages, which LaTeX authors\nare \"entitled to assume\" will be present on any system running\nLaTeX; and - a minimal set of documentation detailing\ndifferences from the 'old' version of LaTeX in the areas of\nuser commands, font selection and control, class and package\nwriting, font encodings, configuration options and modification\nof LaTeX.
