The Kerkis font set has some support\nfor mathematics as well as other glyphs missing from the base\nURW Bookman fonts (the URW fonts are duplicated in the\ndistribution). Macros are provided to use the fonts in OT1, T1\n(only NG/ng glyphs missing) and LGR encodings, as well as in\nmathematics; small caps and old-style number glyphs are also\navailable. The philosophy, and the design process, of the\nKerkis fonts is discussed in a paper in TUGboat 23(3/4), 2002.\n\ndate: 2009-01-15 17:16:29 +0100\n",
