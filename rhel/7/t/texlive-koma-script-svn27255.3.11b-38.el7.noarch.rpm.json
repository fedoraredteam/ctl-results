            "Description": "\nThe KOMA-Script bundle provides drop-in replacements for the\narticle/report/book classes with emphasis on typography and\nversatility. There is also a letter class, different from all\nother letter classes. It also offers e.g. a package for\ncalculated type areas in the way laid down by the typographer\nJan Tschichold, a package for easily changing and defining of\npage styles, a package for getting not only the current date\nbut also the name of day and a package for getting current\ntime. All these packages may be used not only with KOMA-Script\nclasses but also with standard classes. Since every package has\nits own version number, the number below is only the version of\nscrbook, scrreprt, scrartcl, scrlttr2 and typearea. These are\nthe main parts of the bundle.\n\ndate: 2012-07-30 11:22:32 +0200\n",
