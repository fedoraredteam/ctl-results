Seminar is also the basis of other classes,\nsuch as prosper. In fact, seminar is not nowadays reckoned a\ngood basis for a presentation -- users are advised to use more\nrecent classes such as powerdot or beamer, both of which are\ntuned to 21st-century presentation styles. Note that the\nseminar distribution relies on the xcomment package, which was\nonce part of the bundle, but now has a separate existence.\n\ndate: 2010-05-17 14:53:01 +0200\n",
