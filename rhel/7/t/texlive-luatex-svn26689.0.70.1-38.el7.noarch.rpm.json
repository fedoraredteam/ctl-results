The LuaTeX project's main\nobjective is to provide an open and configurable variant of TeX\nwhile at the same time offering downward compatibility. LuaTeX\nuses Unicode (as UTF-8) as its default input encoding, and is\nable to use modern (OpenType) fonts (for both text and\nmathematics). It should be noted that LuaTeX is still under\ndevelopment; its specification has been declared stable, but\nabsolute stability may not in practice be assumed.\n\ndate: 2011-11-09 15:33:34 +0100\n",
