The fonts are available in both MetaFont\nand Adobe Type 1 formats, and a comprehensive support package\nis provided. While the fonts were designed to fit with Minon\nPro, the design should fit well with other renaissance or\nbaroque faces: indeed, it will probably work with most fonts\nthat are neither too wide nor too thin, for example Palatino or\nTimes; it is known to look good with Sabon. There is no package\ndesigned to configure its use with any font other than Minion\nPro, but (for example) simply loading mnsymbol after mathpazo\nwill probably do what is needed.\n\ndate: 2008-08-22 15:19:59 +0200\n",
