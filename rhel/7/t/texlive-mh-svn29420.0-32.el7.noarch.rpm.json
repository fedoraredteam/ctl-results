            "Description": "\nThe mh bundle is a series of packages designed to enhance the\nappearance of documents containing a lot of math. The main\nbackbone is amsmath, so those unfamiliar with this required\npart of the LaTeX system will probably not find the packages\nvery useful. Component parts of the bundle are: breqn, empheq,\nflexisym, mathstyle and mathtools, mhsetup, The empheq package\nis a visual markup extension of amsmath. Empheq allows\nsophisticated boxing and other marking of multi-line maths\ndisplays, and fixes problems with the way that the ntheorem\npackage places end-of-theorem markers. The mathtools package\nprovides many useful tools for mathematical typesetting. It\nfixes various deficiencies of amsmath and standard LaTeX. The\nmhsetup package defines various programming tools needed by\nboth empheq and mathtools. The breqn package makes more easy\nthe business of preparing displayed equations in LaTeX,\nincluding permitting automatic line-breaking within displayed\nequations. (Breqn uses the mathstyle package to keep track of\nthe current maths typesetting style, something that raw TeX\nhides from the programmer.)\n\ndate: 2013-03-17 00:29:52 +0100\n",
