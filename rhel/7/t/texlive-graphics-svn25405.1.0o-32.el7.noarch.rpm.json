            "Description": "\nThe package was designed to accommodate all needs for inclusion\nof graphics in LaTeX documents, replacing many earlier packages\nused in LaTeX 2.09. The package aims to give a consistent\ninterface to including the file types that are understood in\nyour output, by use of 'printer drivers' (now known, simply, as\n'drivers'). The distribtion of the package contains several\ndrivers, but others (for example, pdfTeX) are distributed\nseparately. The package also offers several means of\nmanipulating graphics in the course of inserting them into a\ndocument (for example, rotation and scaling). For extended\ndocumentation see epslatex. The package is part of the graphics\nbundle, which is one of the collections in the LaTeX 'required'\nset of packages.\n\ndate: 2011-05-30 14:43:49 +0200\n",
