The environments allow a break at their start (the\n\\FrameCommand enables creation of a title that is \"attached\" to\nthe environment); breaks are also allowed in the course of the\nframed/shaded matter. There is also a command \\MakeFramed to\nmake your own framed-style environments.\n\ndate: 2012-06-01 12:48:04 +0200\n",
