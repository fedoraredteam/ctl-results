            "Description": "\nThe vision of the Social Semantic Desktop defines a user\u2019s personal\ninformation environment as a source and end-point of the Semantic Web:\nKnowledge workers comprehensively express their information and data\nwith respect to their own conceptualizations.\n\nSemantic Web languages and protocols are used to formalize these\nconceptualizations and for coordinating local and global information\naccess. The Resource Description Framework serves as a common data\nrepresentation format. With a particular focus on addressing certain\nlimitations of RDF, a novel representational language akin to RDF and\nthe Web Ontology Language, plus a number of other high-level\nontologies were created.\n\nTogether, they provide a means to build the semantic bridges necessary\nfor data exchange and application integration on distributed social\nsemantic desktops. Although initially designed to fulfill requirements\nfor the Nepomuk project, these ontologies are useful for the semantic\nweb community in general.\n",
