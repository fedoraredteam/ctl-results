            "Description": "\nThis package adds support for monitoring and communicating with amavisd\nand auxiliary services among themselves through 0MQ sockets (also called ZMQ\nor ZeroMQ, or Crossroads I/O or XS). This method offers similar features\nas current services amavisd-nanny, amavisd-agent and amavisd-snmp-subagent,\nbut use message passing paradigm instead of communicating through a shared\nBerkeley database. This avoids locking contention, so the gain can be\nsignificant for a busy amavisd setup with lots of child processes.\n",
