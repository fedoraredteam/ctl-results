Since it has to be run on your server and\nhave access to your private Let's Encrypt account key, I tried to make it as\ntiny as possible (currently less than 200 lines). The only prerequisites are\npython and openssl.\n\nWell, that and a web server - but then you only need this with a web server.\nThis package adds a simple directory layout and timer service that runs\nacme_tiny on installed CSRs as the acme user for privilege separation.\n",
