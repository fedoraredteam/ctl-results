            "Description": "\nMany Apache projects support interaction with a relational database. Creating a\nnew connection for each user can be time consuming (often requiring multiple\nseconds of clock time), in order to perform a database transaction that might\ntake milliseconds. Opening a connection per user can be unfeasible in a\npublicly-hosted Internet application where the number of simultaneous users can\nbe very large. Accordingly, developers often wish to share a \"pool\" of open\nconnections between all of the application's current users. The number of users\nactually performing a request at any given time is usually a very small\npercentage of the total number of active users, and during request processing\nis the only time that a database connection is required. The application itself\nlogs into the DBMS, and handles any user account issues internally.\n",
