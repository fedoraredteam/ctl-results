            "Description": "\nThe ATLAS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software) project is an\nongoing research effort focusing on applying empirical techniques in\norder to provide portable performance. At present, it provides C and\nFortran77 interfaces to a portably efficient BLAS implementation, as\nwell as a few routines from LAPACK.\n\nThe performance improvements in ATLAS are obtained largely via\ncompile-time optimizations and tend to be specific to a given hardware\nconfiguration. In order to package ATLAS some compromises\nare necessary so that good performance can be obtained on a variety\nof hardware. This set of ATLAS binary packages is therefore not\nnecessarily optimal for any specific hardware configuration.  However,\nthe source package can be used to compile customized ATLAS packages;\nsee the documentation for information.\n",
