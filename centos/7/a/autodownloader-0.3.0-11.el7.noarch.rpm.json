It will prompt the user explaining to him the\nneed of the download and asking if it is ok to make an internet connection,\nafter this it will show the license of the to be downloaded files and last it\nwill do the actual download and md5 verification off these files. This whole\nprocess can be configured by the packager through a simple configuration file.\n\nNotice that Autodownloader while open source itself, may download files which\nare not permitted to be (re)distributed unlike most files in Fedora.\n",
