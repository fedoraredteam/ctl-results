JEXL is inspired by Jakarta Velocity\nand the Expression Language defined in the JavaServer Pages Standard Tag\nLibrary version 1.1 (JSTL) and JavaServer Pages version 2.0 (JSP).  While\ninspired by JSTL EL, it must be noted that JEXL is not a compatible\nimplementation of EL as defined in JSTL 1.1 (JSR-052) or JSP 2.0 (JSR-152).\nFor a compatible implementation of these specifications, see the Commons EL\nproject.\n\nJEXL attempts to bring some of the lessons learned by the Velocity community\nabout expression languages in templating to a wider audience.  Commons Jelly\nneeded Velocity-ish method access, it just had to have it.\n",
