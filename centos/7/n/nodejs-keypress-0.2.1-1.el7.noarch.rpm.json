            "Description": "\nPrevious to Node v0.8.x, there was an undocumented \"keypress\" event that\nprocess.stdin would emit when it was a TTY. Some people discovered this\nhidden gem, and started using it in their own code.\n\nIn Node v0.8.x, this \"keypress\" event does not get emitted by default,\nbut rather only when it is being used in conjunction with the readline\n(or by extension, the repl) module.\n\nThis module is the exact logic from the node v0.8.x releases ripped out\ninto its own module.\n",
