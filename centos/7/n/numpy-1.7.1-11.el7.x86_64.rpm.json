NumPy is built on the Numeric code base and adds features\nintroduced by numarray as well as an extended C-API and the ability to\ncreate arrays of arbitrary type.\n\nThere are also basic facilities for discrete fourier transform,\nbasic linear algebra and random number generation. Also included in\nthis package is a version of f2py that works properly with NumPy.\n",
