            "Description": "\nAsync is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions\nfor working with asynchronous JavaScript. Although originally designed for\nuse with Node.js, it can also be used directly in the browser.\n\nAsync provides around 20 functions that include the usual 'functional'\nsuspects (map, reduce, filter, forEach\u2026) as well as some common patterns\nfor asynchronous control flow (parallel, series, waterfall\u2026). All these\nfunctions assume you follow the Node.js convention of providing a single\ncallback as the last argument of your async function.\n",
