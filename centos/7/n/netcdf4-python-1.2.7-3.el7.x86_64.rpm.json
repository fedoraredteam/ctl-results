            "Description": "\nnetCDF version 4 has many features not found in earlier versions of the\nlibrary and is implemented on top of HDF5. This module can read and write\nfiles in both the new netCDF 4 and the old netCDF 3 format, and can create\nfiles that are readable by HDF5 clients. The API modeled after\nScientific.IO.NetCDF, and should be familiar to users of that module.\n\nMost new features of netCDF 4 are implemented, such as multiple unlimited\ndimensions, groups and zlib data compression. All the new numeric data types\n(such as 64 bit and unsigned integer types) are implemented. Compound and\nvariable length (vlen) data types are supported, but the enum and opaque data\ntypes are not. Mixtures of compound and vlen data types (compound types\ncontaining vlens, and vlens containing compound types) are not supported.\n",
