            "Description": "\nThis is a Node.js module for simple dependency graph management in JavaScript.\n\nSay you have a set of resources that depend on each other in some way. These\nresources can be anything (eg, files, chains of command etc.).\nAll that matters is that each one has a unique string identifier, and a list\nof direct dependencies.\n\ndep-graph makes it easy to compute \"chains\" of dependencies, with guaranteed\nlogical ordering and no duplicates. That's trivial in most cases, but if A\ndepends on B and B depends on A, a na\u00efve dependency graph would get trapped\nin an infinite loop. dep-graph throws an error if any such \"cycles\" are\ndetected.\n",
