            "Description": "\nThis module is a multiple transport asynchronous logging library for Node.js.\n\nWinston is designed to be a simple and universal logging library with support\nfor multiple transports. A transport is essentially a storage device for your\nlogs. Each instance of a winston logger can have multiple transports\nconfigured at different levels. For example, one may want error logs to be\nstored in a persistent remote location (like a database), but all logs output\nto the console or a local file.\n\nThere also seemed to be a lot of logging libraries out there that coupled\ntheir implementation of logging (ie, how the logs are stored/indexed) to the\nAPI that they exposed to the programmer. This library aims to decouple those\nparts of the process to make it more flexible and extensible.\n",
