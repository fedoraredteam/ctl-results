It's a powerful combination of small\nsize, high performance, debuggability, and rich features:\n\n * Resolve arrays and hashes of promises, as well as infinite promise sequences\n * Execute tasks in parallel or sequentially\n * Transform Node-style and other callback-based APIs into promise-based APIs\n\nWhen.js is one of the many stand-alone components of cujoJS, the JavaScript\nArchitectural Toolkit.\n",
