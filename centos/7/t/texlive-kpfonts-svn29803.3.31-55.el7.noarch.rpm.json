            "Description": "\nThe family contains text fonts in roman, sans-serif and\nmonospaced shapes, with true small caps and old-style numbers;\nthe package offers full support of the textcomp package. The\nmathematics fonts include all the AMS fonts, in both normal and\nbold weights. Each of the font types is available in two main\nversions: default and 'light'. Each version is available in\nfour variants: default; oldstyle numbers; oldstyle numbers with\nold ligatures such as ct and st, and long-tailed capital Q; and\nveryoldstyle with long s. Other variants include small caps as\ndefault or 'large small caps', and for mathematics both upright\nand slanted shapes for Greek letters, as well as default and\nnarrow versions of multiple integrals. The fonts were\noriginally derived from URW Palladio (with URW's agreement)\nthough the fonts are very clearly different in appearance from\ntheir parent.\n",
