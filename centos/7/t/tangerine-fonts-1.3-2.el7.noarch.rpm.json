            "Description": "\nTangerine is a calligraphy font inspired by many italic chancery hands from\nthe 16-17th century. Its tall ascender, the most distinct characteristic of\nthis type, takes a wide line space between lines and gives it a graceful\ntexture. It is generally advisable to use Tangerine for a title or short text\nat large size because of the short height of lowercase letters. Tangerine is\nproduced by Japanese type designer Toshi Omagari and was named after a woman\nwho encouraged him to begin this work.\n",
