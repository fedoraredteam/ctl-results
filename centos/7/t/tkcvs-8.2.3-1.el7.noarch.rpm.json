            "Description": "\nTkCVS is a Tcl/Tk-based graphical interface to the CVS and Subversion\nconfiguration management systems. It will also help with RCS. TkDiff\nis included for browsing and merging your changes.\n\nTkCVS shows the status of the files in the current working directory,\nand has tools for tagging, merging, importing, exporting, checking\nin/out, and other user operations.\n\nTkCVS also aids in browsing the repository. For Subversion, the\nrepository tree is browsed like an ordinary file tree. For CVS, the\nCVSROOT/modules file is read. TkCVS extends CVS with a method to\nproduce a \"user friendly\" listing of modules. This requires special\ncomments in the CVSROOT/modules file.\n\nAlthough TkCVS now supports Subversion, it will still work happily\nwithout it in your CVS directories. It didn't abandon CVS, it just\ngrew some new capabilities.\n",
