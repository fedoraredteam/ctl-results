            "Description": "\nThe well-known Euler fonts are suitable for typsetting\nmathematics in conjunction with a variety of text fonts which\ndo not provide mathematical character sets of their own. Euler-\nVM is a set of virtual mathematics fonts based on Euler and CM.\nThis approach has several advantages over immediately using the\nreal Euler fonts: Most noticeably, less TeX resources are\nconsumed, the quality of various math symbols is improved and a\nusable \\hslash symbol can be provided. The virtual fonts are\naccompanied by a LaTeX package which makes them easy to use,\nparticularly in conjunction with Type1 PostScript text fonts.\nThey are compatible with amsmath. A package option allows the\nfonts to be loaded at 95% of their nominal size, thus blending\nbetter with certain text fonts, e.g., Minion.\n",
