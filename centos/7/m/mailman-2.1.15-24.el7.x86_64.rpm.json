Unlike most similar products, Mailman gives\neach mailing list a webpage, and allows users to subscribe,\nunsubscribe, etc. over the Web. Even the list manager can administer\nhis or her list entirely from the Web. Mailman also integrates most\nthings people want to do with mailing lists, including archiving, mail\n<-> news gateways, and so on.\n\nDocumentation can be found in: /usr/share/doc/mailman-2.1.15\n\nWhen the package has finished installing, you will need to perform some\nadditional installation steps, these are described in:\n/usr/share/doc/mailman-2.1.15/INSTALL.REDHAT\n",
