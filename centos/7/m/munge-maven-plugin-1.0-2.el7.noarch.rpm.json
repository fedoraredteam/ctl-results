            "Description": "\nMunge is a purposely-simple Java preprocessor. It only supports\nconditional inclusion of source based on defined strings of the\nform \"if[tag]\", \"if_not[tag]\", \"else[tag]\", and \"end[tag]\".\nUnlike traditional preprocessors, comments, and formatting are all\npreserved for the included lines. This is on purpose, as the output\nof Munge will be distributed as human-readable source code.\n\nTo avoid creating a separate Java dialect, the conditional tags are\ncontained in Java comments. This allows one build to compile the\nsource files without pre-processing, to facilitate faster incremental\ndevelopment. Other builds from the same source have their code contained\nwithin that comment. The format of the tags is a little verbose, so\nthat the tags won't accidentally be used by other comment readers\nsuch as javadoc. Munge tags must be in C-style comments;\nC++-style comments may be used to comment code within a comment.\n\nLike any preprocessor, developers must be careful not to abuse its\ncapabilities so that their code becomes unreadable. Please use it\nas little as possible.\n",
