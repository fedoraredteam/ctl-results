            "Description": "\nMPICH is a high-performance and widely portable implementation of the Message\nPassing Interface (MPI) standard (MPI-1, MPI-2 and MPI-3). The goals of MPICH\nare: (1) to provide an MPI implementation that efficiently supports different\ncomputation and communication platforms including commodity clusters (desktop\nsystems, shared-memory systems, multicore architectures), high-speed networks\n(10 Gigabit Ethernet, InfiniBand, Myrinet, Quadrics) and proprietary high-end\ncomputing systems (Blue Gene, Cray) and (2) to enable cutting-edge research in\nMPI through an easy-to-extend modular framework for other derived\nimplementations.\n\nThe mpich binaries in this RPM packages were configured to use the default\nprocess manager (Hydra) using the default device (ch3). The ch3 device\nwas configured with support for the nemesis channel that allows for\nshared-memory and TCP/IP sockets based communication.\n\nThis package provides compatibility for applications compiled with MPICH 3.0.4.\n",
