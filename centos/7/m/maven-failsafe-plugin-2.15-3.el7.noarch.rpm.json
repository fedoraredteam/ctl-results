The name (failsafe) was\nchosen both because it is a synonym of surefire and because it implies\nthat when it fails, it does so in a safe way.\n\nIf you use the Surefire Plugin for running tests, then when you have a\ntest failure, the build will stop at the integration-test phase and\nyour integration test environment will not have been torn down\ncorrectly.\n\nThe Failsafe Plugin is used during the integration-test and verify\nphases of the build lifecycle to execute the integration tests of an\napplication. The Failsafe Plugin will not fail the build during the\nintegration-test phase thus enabling the post-integration-test phase\nto execute.\n",
