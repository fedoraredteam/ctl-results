            "Description": "\nExperienced Pythonistas need support for quick and dirty GUI features. New\nPython programmers need GUI capabilities that don't require any knowledge\nof Tkinter, frames, widgets, callbacks or lambda. This is what EasyGUI\nprovides. Using EasyGUI, all GUI interactions are invoked by simple\nfunction calls.\n\nEasyGUI is different from other GUIs in that EasyGUI is NOT event-driven.\nIt allows you to program in a traditional linear fashion, and to put up\ndialogs for simple input and output when you need to. If you have not yet\nlearned the event-driven paradigm for GUI programming, EasyGUI will allow\nyou to be productive with very basic tasks immediately. Later, if you\nwish to make the transition to an event-driven GUI paradigm, you can do\nso with a more powerful GUI package such as anygui, PythonCard, Tkinter,\nwxPython, etc.\nThis package allows for use of easygui with Python 3.\n",
