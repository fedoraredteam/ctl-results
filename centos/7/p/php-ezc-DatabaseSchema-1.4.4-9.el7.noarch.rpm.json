            "Description": "\nThe DatabaseSchema component provides a unified data structure to describe\nrelational databases. DatabaseSchema can read and write the structure from and\nto several databases (such as MySQL, SQLite and Oracle) and also read and write\nin two web language files (XML and PHP).\n\nThe main intention of the component is to extract an already existing schema\nfrom a database, and compare it with either a predefined schema to check for\nany changes. Although the component does allow you to create the schema manually\nthrough the API, it is often easier to create the schema yourself in a database,\nand then extract the data from it.\n",
