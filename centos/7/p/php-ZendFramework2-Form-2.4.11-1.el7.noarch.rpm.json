            "Description": "\nZend\\Form is intended primarily as a bridge between your domain models and the\nView Layer. It composes a thin layer of objects representing form elements, an\nInputFilter, and a small number of methods for binding data to and from the\nform and attached objects.\n\nThe Zend\\Form component consists of the following objects:\n\n* Elements, which simply consist of a name and attributes.\n* Fieldsets, which extend from Elements, but allow composing other fieldsets\n  and elements.\n* Forms, which extend from Fieldsets (and thus Elements). They provide data\n  and object binding, and compose InputFilters. Data binding is done via\n  ZendStdlibHydrator.\n",
