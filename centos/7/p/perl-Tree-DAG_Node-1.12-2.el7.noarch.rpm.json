The tree structure is not an object itself, but is emergent\nfrom the linkages you create between nodes. This class provides the methods\nfor making linkages that can be used to build up a tree, while preventing you\nfrom ever making any kinds of linkages that are not allowed in a tree (such as\nhaving a node be its own mother or ancestor, or having a node have two\nmothers).\n",
