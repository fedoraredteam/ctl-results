            "Description": "\nSilex is a PHP micro-framework. It is built on the shoulders of Symfony and\nPimple and also inspired by Sinatra.\n\nA micro-framework provides the guts for building simple single-file apps. Silex\naims to be:\n* Concise: Silex exposes an intuitive and concise API that is fun to use\n* Extensible: Silex has an extension system based around the Pimple micro\n  service-container that makes it even easier to tie in third party libraries\n* Testable: Silex uses Symfony's HttpKernel which abstracts requests and\n  responses. This makes it very easy to test apps and the framework itself.\n  It also respects the HTTP specification and encourages its' proper use.\n",
