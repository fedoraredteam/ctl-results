            "Description": "\nMpmath is a pure-Python library for multiprecision floating-point arithmetic.\nIt provides an extensive set of transcendental functions, unlimited exponent\nsizes, complex numbers, interval arithmetic, numerical integration and\ndifferentiation, root-finding, linear algebra, and much more. Almost any\ncalculation can be performed just as well at 10-digit or 1000-digit precision,\nand in many cases mpmath implements asymptotically fast algorithms that scale\nwell for extremely high precision work. If available, mpmath will (optionally)\nuse gmpy to speed up high precision operations.\n\nIf you require plotting capabilities in mpmath, install python-matplotlib.\n",
