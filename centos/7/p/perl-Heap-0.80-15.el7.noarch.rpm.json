A heap is a partially sorted structure that is always able to\neasily extract the smallest of the elements in the structure (or the\nlargest if a reversed compare routine is provided).\n\nIf the collection of elements is changing dynamically, the heap has less\noverhead than keeping the collection fully sorted.\n\nThe elements must be objects as described in \"Heap::Elem\" and all\nelements inserted into one heap must be mutually compatible - either\nthe same class exactly or else classes that differ only in ways unrelated\nto the Heap::Elem interface.\n",
