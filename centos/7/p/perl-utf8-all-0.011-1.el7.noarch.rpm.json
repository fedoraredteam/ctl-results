That means UTF-8\nstrings, variable names, and regular expressions. utf8::all goes further, and\nmakes @ARGV encoded in UTF-8, and file handles are opened with UTF-8 encoding\nturned on by default (including STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR), and character names\nare imported so \\N{...} sequences can be used to compile Unicode characters\nbased on names. If you don't want UTF-8 for a particular file handle, you'll\nhave to set binmode $filehandle.\n",
