Examples of usage can be\nfound in the unit tests and the samples provided.  This module facilitates\ndistributing simple operations into jobs that are sent to worker threads,\nmaintained by a pool object.\n\nIt consists of these components:\n\n* Jobs - single units of work that need to be performed.\n* Workers - workers grab jobs from a queue and run them.\n* Worker pool - keeps track of workers and the job queue.\n",
