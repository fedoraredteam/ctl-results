            "Description": "\nPexpect is a pure Python module for spawning child applications; controlling\nthem; and responding to expected patterns in their output. Pexpect works like\nDon Libes' Expect. Pexpect allows your script to spawn a child application and\ncontrol it as if a human were typing commands.\n\nPexpect can be used for automating interactive applications such as ssh, ftp,\npasswd, telnet, etc. It can be used to automate setup scripts for duplicating\nsoftware package installations on different servers. And it can be used for\nautomated software testing. Pexpect is in the spirit of Don Libes' Expect, but\nPexpect is pure Python. Unlike other Expect-like modules for Python, Pexpect\ndoes not require TCL or Expect nor does it require C extensions to be compiled.\nIt should work on any platform that supports the standard Python pty module.\n",
