            "Description": "\nPBKDF2 is a secure password hashing algorithm that uses the techniques of\n\"key strengthening\" to make the complexity of a brute-force attack\narbitrarily high. PBKDF2 uses any other cryptographic hash or cipher (by\nconvention, usually HMAC-SHA1, but Crypt::PBKDF2 is fully pluggable), and\nallows for an arbitrary number of iterations of the hashing function, and a\nnearly unlimited output hash size (up to 2**32 - 1 times the size of the\noutput of the back-end hash). The hash is salted, as any password hash\nshould be, and the salt may also be of arbitrary size.\n",
