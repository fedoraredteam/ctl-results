Community feedback,\nbug reports and patches has led to a stable 1.0 release in 2010, a 2.0 release\nin 2013, and a 3.0 release in 2014.\n\nPheanstalk 3.0 introduces PHP namespaces, PSR-1 and PSR-2 coding standards, and\nPSR-4 autoloader standard.\n\nbeanstalkd up to the latest version 1.4 is supported. All commands and responses\nspecified in the protocol documentation for beanstalkd 1.3 are implemented.\n\nAutoloader: /usr/share/php/Pheanstalk/autoload.php\n\n[1] http://xph.us/software/beanstalkd/\n[2] http://paul.annesley.cc/\n",
