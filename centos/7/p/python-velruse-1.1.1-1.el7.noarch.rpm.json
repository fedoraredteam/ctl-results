            "Description": "\nVelruse is a set of authentication routines that provide a unified way\nto have a website user authenticate to a variety of different identity\nproviders and/or a variety of different authentication schemes.\n\nIt is similar in some ways to Janrain Engage with the exception of being\nopen-source, locally installable, and easily pluggable for custom identity\nproviders and authentication schemes.\n\nYou can run Velruse as a stand-alone service for use with your websites\nregardless of the language they\u2019re written in. While Velruse itself is\nwritten in Python, since it can interact with your website purely via HTTP\nPOST\u2019s.\n\nVelruse can:\n\n - Normalize identity information from varying provider sources (OpenID,\n   Google, Facebook, etc.) to Portable Contacts.\n - Simplify complex authentication protocols by providing a simple\n   consistent API\n - Provide extension points for other authentication systems, write your\n   own auth provider to handle CAS, LDAP, and use it with ease\n - Integrate with most web applications regardless of the language used to\n   write the website\n\nVelruse aims to simplify authenticating a user. It provides auth provider\u2018s\nthat handle authenticating to a variety of identity providers with multiple\nauthentication schemes (LDAP, SAML, etc.). Eventually, Velruse will include\nwidgets similar to RPXNow that allow one to customize a login/registration\nwidget so that a website user can select a preferred identity provider to\nuse to sign-in. In the mean-time, effort is focused on increasing the\navailable auth provider\u2018s for the commonly used authentication schemes and\nidentity providers (Facebook, Google, OpenID, etc). Unlike other\nauthentication libraries for use with web applications, a website using\nVelruse for authentication does not have to be written in any particular\nlanguage.\n",
