It is primarily based work for the Etherx XML router\ndeveloped by the Jabber Development Team.  For more information about this\nproject visit http://etherx.jabber.org/stream/.\n\nXML::Stream gives the user the ability to define a central callback that\nwill be used to handle the tags received from the server.  These tags are\npassed in the format defined at instantiation time.  the closing tag of an\nobject is seen, the tree is finished and passed to the call back function.\nWhat the user does with it from there is up to them.\n\nFor a detailed description of how this module works, and about the data\nstructure that it returns, please view the source of Stream.pm and\nlook at the detailed description at the end of the file.\n",
