The\npurpose of the Changes file is to help a user figure out what has changed\nsince the last release.\n\nPeople have devised many ways to write the Changes file. A preliminary\nspecification has been created (CPAN::Changes::Spec) to encourage module\nauthors to write clear and concise Changes.\n\nThis module will help users programmatically read and write Changes files\nthat conform to the specification.\n",
