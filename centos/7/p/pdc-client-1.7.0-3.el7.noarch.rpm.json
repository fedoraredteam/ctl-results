            "Description": "\nThis client package contains two separate Product Definition Center clients and\nAPI module. Both clients contain extensive built-in help. Just run the\nexecutable with -h or --help argument.\n\n1. pdc_client\n\nThis is a very simple client. Essentially this is just a little more convenient\nthan using curl manually. Each invocation of this client obtains a token and\nthen performs a single request.\n\nThis client is not meant for direct usage, but just as a helper for integrating\nwith PDC from languages where it might be easier than performing the network\nrequests manually.\n\n2. pdc\n\nThis is much more user friendly user interface. A single invocation can perform\nmultiple requests depending on what subcommand you used.\n\nThe pdc client supports Bash completion if argcomplete Python package is\ninstalled.\n\n3. Python API (pdc_client)\n\nWhen writing a client code interfacing with PDC server, you might find\npdc_client module handy. It provides access to the configuration defined above\nand automates obtaining authorization token.\n",
