            "Description": "\nGNU Parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using one or more\nmachines. A job is typically a single command or a small script that has to be\nrun for each of the lines in the input. The typical input is a list of files, a\nlist of hosts, a list of users, or a list of tables.\n\nIf you use xargs today you will find GNU Parallel very easy to use. If you\nwrite loops in shell, you will find GNU Parallel may be able to replace most of\nthe loops and make them run faster by running jobs in parallel. If you use ppss\nor pexec you will find GNU Parallel will often make the command easier to read.\n\nGNU Parallel also makes sure output from the commands is the same output as you\nwould get had you run the commands sequentially. This makes it possible to use\noutput from GNU Parallel as input for other programs.\n\nGNU Parallel is command-line-compatible with moreutils' parallel, but offers\nadditional features.\n",
