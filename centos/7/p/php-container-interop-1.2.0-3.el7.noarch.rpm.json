            "Description": "\ncontainer-interop tries to identify and standardize features in container\nobjects (service locators, dependency injection containers, etc.) to achieve\ninteropererability.\n\nThrough discussions and trials, we try to create a standard, made of common\ninterfaces but also recommendations.\n\nIf PHP projects that provide container implementations begin to adopt these\ncommon standards, then PHP applications and projects that use containers can\ndepend on the common interfaces instead of specific implementations. This\nfacilitates a high-level of interoperability and flexibility that allows users\nto consume any container implementation that can be adapted to these interfaces.\n\nThe work done in this project is not officially endorsed by the PHP-FIG [1],\nbut it is being worked on by members of PHP-FIG and other good developers. We\nadhere to the spirit and ideals of PHP-FIG, and hope this project will pave the\nway for one or more future PSRs.\n\nAutoloader: /usr/share/php/Interop/Container/autoload.php\n\n[1] http://www.php-fig.org/\n",
