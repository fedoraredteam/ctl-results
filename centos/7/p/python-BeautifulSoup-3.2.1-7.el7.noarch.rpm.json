Three features make it\npowerful:\n\nBeautiful Soup won't choke if you give it bad markup.\n\nBeautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic idioms for\nnavigating, searching, and modifying a parse tree.\n\nBeautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents to Unicode\nand outgoing documents to UTF-8.\n\nBeautiful Soup parses anything you give it.\n\nValuable data that was once locked up in poorly-designed websites is\nnow within your reach. Projects that would have taken hours take only\nminutes with Beautiful Soup.\n",
