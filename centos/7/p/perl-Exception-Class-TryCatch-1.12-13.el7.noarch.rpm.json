            "Description": "\nException::Class::TryCatch provides syntactic sugar for use with\nException::Class using the familiar keywords try and catch. Its primary\nobjective is to allow users to avoid dealing directly with $@ by ensuring\nthat any exceptions caught in an eval are captured as Exception::Class\nobjects, whether they were thrown objects to begin with or whether the\nerror resulted from die. This means that users may immediately use isa and\nvarious Exception::Class methods to process the exception.\n",
