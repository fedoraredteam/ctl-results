            "Description": "\nZend Framework 2 features built-in console support.\n\nWhen a Zend\\Application is run from a console window (a shell window), it will\nrecognize this fact and prepare Zend\\Mvc components to handle the request.\nConsole support is enabled by default, but to function properly it requires at\nleast one console route and one action controller to handle the request.\n\n* Console routing allows you to invoke controllers and action depending on\n  command line parameters provided by the user.\n* Module Manager integration allows ZF2 applications and modules to display\n  help and usage information, in case the command line has not been understood\n  (no route matched).\n* Console-aware action controllers will receive a console request containing\n  all named parameters and flags. They are able to send output back to the\n  console window.\n* Console adapters provide a level of abstraction for interacting with console\n  on different operating systems.\n* Console prompts can be used to interact with the user by asking him questions\n  and retrieving input.\n",
