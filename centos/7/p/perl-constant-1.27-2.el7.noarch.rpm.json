Also, your program will be easier to read, more likely\nto be maintained (and maintained correctly), and far less likely to\nsend a space probe to the wrong planet because nobody noticed the one\nequation in which you wrote 3.14195.\n\nWhen a constant is used in an expression, Perl replaces it with its\nvalue at compile time, and may then optimize the expression further.\nIn particular, any code in an \"if (CONSTANT)\" block will be optimized\naway if the constant is false.\n",
