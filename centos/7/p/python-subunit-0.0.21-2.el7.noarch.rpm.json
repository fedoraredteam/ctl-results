            "Description": "\nSubunit is a streaming protocol for test results.  The protocol is a\nbinary encoding that is easily generated and parsed.  By design all the\ncomponents of the protocol conceptually fit into the xUnit TestCase ->\nTestResult interaction.\n\nSubunit comes with command line filters to process a subunit stream and\nlanguage bindings for python, C, C++ and shell.  Bindings are easy to\nwrite for other languages.\n\nA number of useful things can be done easily with subunit:\n- Test aggregation: Tests run separately can be combined and then\n  reported/displayed together.  For instance, tests from different\n  languages can be shown as a seamless whole.\n- Test archiving: A test run may be recorded and replayed later.\n- Test isolation: Tests that may crash or otherwise interact badly with\n  each other can be run separately and then aggregated, rather than\n  interfering with each other.\n- Grid testing: subunit can act as the necessary serialization and\n  deserialization to get test runs on distributed machines to be\n  reported in real time.\n",
