Simple I/O\nmethods such as print, get, and getline are provided. More sophisticated\ninteractive features are provided because connecting to a TELNET port\nultimately means communicating with a program designed for human interaction.\nThese interactive features include the ability to specify a time-out and to\nwait for patterns to appear in the input stream, such as the prompt from a\nshell.\n",
