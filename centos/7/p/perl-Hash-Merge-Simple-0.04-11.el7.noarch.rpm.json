The merge function will descend and\nmerge hashes that exist under the same node in both the left and right\nhash, but doesn't attempt to combine arrays, objects, scalars, or\nanything else. The rightmost hash also takes precedence, replacing\nwhatever was in the left hash if a conflict occurs. This code was pretty\nmuch taken straight from Catalyst::Utils, and modified to handle more\nthan 2 hashes at the same time.\n",
