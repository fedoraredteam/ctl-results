There is no database abstraction layer, no form\nvalidation or anything else where different libraries already exist\nthat can handle that. However Flask knows the concept of extensions\nthat can add this functionality into your application as if it was\nimplemented in Flask itself. There are currently extensions for object\nrelational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open\nauthentication technologies and more.\n",
