            "Description": "\nThe Inline module allows you to put source code from other programming\nlanguages directly \"inline\" in a Perl script or module. The code is\nautomatically compiled as needed, and then loaded for immediate access\nfrom Perl.\n\nInline saves you from the hassle of having to write and compile your\nown glue code using facilities like XS or SWIG. Simply type the code\nwhere you want it and run your Perl as normal. All the hairy details\nare handled for you. The compilation and installation of your code\nchunks all happen transparently; all you will notice is the delay of\ncompilation on the first run.\n\nThe Inline code only gets compiled the first time you run it (or\nwhenever it is modified) so you only take the performance hit\nonce. Code that is Inlined into distributed modules (like on the CPAN)\nwill get compiled when the module is installed, so the end user will\nnever notice the compilation time.\n",
