            "Description": "\nMock-Quick is here to solve the current problems with Mocking libraries.\n\nThere are a couple of Mocking libraries available on CPAN. The primary problems\nwith these libraries include verbose syntax, and most importantly side-effects.\nSome Mocking libraries expect you to mock a specific class, and will unload it\nthen redefine it. This is particularly a problem if you only want to override\na class on a lexical level.\n\nMock-Object provides a declarative mocking interface that results in a very\nconcise, but clear syntax. There are separate facilities for mocking object\ninstances, and classes. You can quickly create an instance of an object with\ncustom attributes and methods. You can also quickly create an anonymous class,\noptionally inheriting from another, with whatever methods you desire.\n\nMock-Object also provides a tool that provides an OO interface to overriding\nmethods in existing classes. This tool also allows for the restoration of the\noriginal class methods. Best of all, this is a localized tool: when your\ncontrol object falls out of scope, the original class is restored.\n",
