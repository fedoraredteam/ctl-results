            "Description": "\nnose extends the test loading and running features of unittest, making\nit easier to write, find and run tests.\n\nBy default, nose will run tests in files or directories under the\ncurrent working directory whose names include \"test\" or \"Test\" at a\nword boundary (like \"test_this\" or \"functional_test\" or \"TestClass\"\nbut not \"libtest\"). Test output is similar to that of unittest, but\nalso includes captured stdout output from failing tests, for easy\nprint-style debugging.\n\nThese features, and many more, are customizable through the use of\nplugins. Plugins included with nose provide support for doctest, code\ncoverage and profiling, flexible attribute-based test selection,\noutput capture and more.\n\nThis package installs the nose module and nosetests-3.4 program that\ncan discover python34 unittests.\n",
