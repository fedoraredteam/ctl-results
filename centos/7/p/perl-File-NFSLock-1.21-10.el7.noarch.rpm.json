Some routine flow is taken from\nthere -- particularly the idea of creating a random local file, hard\nlinking a common file to the local file, and then checking the nlink\nstatus. Some ideologies were not complete (uncache mechanism, shared\nlocking) and some coding was even incorrect (wrong stat index).\nFile::NFSLock was written to be light, generic, and fast.\n",
