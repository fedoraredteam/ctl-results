Authentication is loosely defined as determining whether\nan entity actually is what it purports to be (i.e., identification),\nbased on some set of credentials. Authorization, the process of deciding\nwhether to allow an entity access to, or to perform operations upon, other\nentities is outside the scope of Zend\\Authentication. For more information\nabout authorization and access control with Zend Framework, please see the\nZend\\Permissions\\Acl or Zend\\Permissions\\Rbac component.\n",
