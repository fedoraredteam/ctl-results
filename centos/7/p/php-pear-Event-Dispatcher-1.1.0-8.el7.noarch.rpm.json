This\ninformation is encapsulated in Event_Notification objects. Client\nobjects register themselves with the Event_Dispatcher as observers of\nspecific notifications posted by other objects. When an event occurs,\nan object posts an appropriate notification to the Event_Dispatcher.\nThe Event_Dispatcher dispatches a message to each registered\nobserver, passing the notification as the sole argument.\n",
