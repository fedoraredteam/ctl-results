            "Description": "\nToolz provides a set of utility functions for iterators, functions, and\ndictionaries. These functions interoperate well and form the building blocks\nof common data analytic operations. They extend the standard libraries\nitertools and functools and borrow heavily from the standard libraries of\ncontemporary functional languages.\n\nToolz provides a suite of functions which have the following functional\nvirtues:\n\n    Composable: They interoperate due to their use of core data structures.\n    Pure: They don\u2019t change their inputs or rely on external state.\n    Lazy: They don\u2019t run until absolutely necessary, allowing them to support\n          large streaming data sets.\n\nToolz functions are pragmatic. They understand that most programmers have\ndeadlines.\n\n    Low Tech: They\u2019re just functions, no syntax or magic tricks to learn\n    Tuned: They\u2019re profiled and optimized\n    Serializable: They support common solutions for parallel computing\n\nThis gives developers the power to write powerful programs to solve complex\nproblems with relatively simple code. This code can be easy to understand\nwithout sacrificing performance. Toolz enables this approach, commonly\nassociated with functional programming, within a natural Pythonic style\nsuitable for most developers.\n",
