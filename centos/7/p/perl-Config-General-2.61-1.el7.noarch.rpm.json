After parsing the module returns a hash structure which contains\nthe representation of the config file.\nThe format of config files supported by Config::General is inspired by\nthe well known Apache config format, in fact, this module is 100%\nread-compatible with Apache configs, but you can also just use simple\nname/value pairs in your config files.\nIn addition to the capabilities of an Apache config file it supports\nsome enhancements such as here-documents, C-style comments or\nmultiline options. It is also possible to save the config back to\ndisk, which makes the module a perfect backend for configuration\ninterfaces.\nIt is possible to use variables in config files and there exists also\nsupport for object oriented access to the configuration.\n",
