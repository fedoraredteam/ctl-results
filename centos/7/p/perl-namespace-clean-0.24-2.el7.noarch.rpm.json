This does not per se cause\nproblems, but it can complicate subclassing and, for example, plugin\nclasses that are included via multiple inheritance by loading them as\nbase classes.\n\nThe 'namespace::clean' pragma will remove all previously declared or\nimported symbols at the end of the current package's compile cycle.\nFunctions called in the package itself will still be bound by their\nname, but they won't show up as methods on your class or instances.\n",
