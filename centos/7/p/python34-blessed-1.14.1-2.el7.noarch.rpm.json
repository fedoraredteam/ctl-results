            "Description": "\nBlessed is a thin, practical wrapper around terminal styling, screen\npositioning, and keyboard input.\n\nIt provides:\n- Styles, color, and maybe a little positioning without necessarily clearing\n  the whole screen first.\n- Works great with standard Python string formatting.\n- Provides up-to-the-moment terminal height and width, so you can responds\n  to terminal size changes.\n- Avoids making a mess if the output gets piped to a non-terminal: outputs\n  to any file-like object such as StringIO, files, or pipes.\n- Uses the terminfo(5) database so it works with any terminal type and\n  supports any terminal capability: No more C-like calls to tigetstr and\n  tparm.\n- Keeps a minimum of internal state, so you can feel free to mix and match\n  with calls to curses or whatever other terminal libraries you like.\n- Provides plenty of context managers to safely express terminal modes,\n  automatically restoring the terminal to a safe state on exit.\n- Act intelligently when somebody redirects your output to a file, omitting\n  all of the terminal sequences such as styling, colors, or positioning.\n- Dead-simple keyboard handling: safely decoding unicode input in your\n  system\u2019s preferred locale and supports application/arrow keys.\n- Allows the printable length of strings containing sequences to be\n  determined.\n",
