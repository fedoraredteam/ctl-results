BDD is a technique derived\nfrom test-first development.\n\nBDD is a technique used at story level and spec level. phpspec is a tool\nfor use at the spec level or SpecBDD. The technique is to first use a tool\nlike phpspec to describe the behaviour of an object you are about to write.\nNext you write just enough code to meet that specification and finally you\nrefactor this code.\n",
