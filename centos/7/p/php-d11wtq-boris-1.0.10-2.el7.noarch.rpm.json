Boris is\nPHP's missing REPL (read-eval-print loop), allowing developers to experiment\nwith PHP code in the terminal in an interactive manner. If you make a mistake,\nit doesn't matter, Boris will report the error and stand to attention for\nfurther input.\n\nEverything you enter into Boris is evaluated and the result inspected so you\ncan understand what is happening. State is maintained between inputs, allowing\nyou to gradually build up a solution to a problem.\n",
