This form shares up to 50 rules by all\nparsers and renderers.\n\nThe package is intented for versatile transformers as well as converters.\nText_Wiki is delivered with its own parser, which is used by Yawiki or\nHorde's Wicked and three basic renderers: XHTML , LaTeX and plain text.\nStrong sanitizing of XHTML is default.\n\nParsers and Renderers exist for BBCode, Cowiki, Dokuwiki, Mediawiki\nand Tikiwiki.\n\nIt is highly configurable and can be easily extended.\n",
