            "Description": "\n\nThe psycogreen package enables psycopg2 to work with co-routine libraries,\nusing asynchronous calls internally but offering a blocking interface so\nthat regular code can run unmodified.  Psycopg offers co-routines support\nsince release 2.2.  Because the main module is a C extension it cannot be\nmonkey-patched to become co-routine-friendly.  Instead it exposes a hook\nthat co-routine libraries can use to install a function integrating with\ntheir event scheduler.  Psycopg will call the function whenever it\nexecutes a libpq call that may block.  Psycogreen is a collection of \u201cwait\ncallbacks\u201d useful to integrate Psycopg with different co-routine libraries.\n",
