            "Description": "\nDB_DataObject_FormBuilder will aid you in rapid application development using\nthe packages DB_DataObject and HTML_QuickForm. For having a quick but working\nprototype of your application, simply model the database, run DataObject's\ncreateTable script over it and write a script that passes one of the resulting\nobjects to the FormBuilder class. The FormBuilder will automatically generate\na simple but working HTML_QuickForm object that you can use to test your\napplication. It also provides a processing method that will automatically\ndetect if an insert() or update() command has to be executed after the form\nhas been submitted. If you have set up DataObject's links.ini file correctly,\nit will also automatically detect if a table field is a foreign key and will\npopulate a selectbox with the linked table's entries. There are many optional\nparameters that you can place in your DataObjects.ini or in the properties of\nyour derived classes, that you can use to fine-tune the form-generation,\ngradually turning the prototypes into fully-featured forms, and you can take\ncontrol at any stage of the process.\n",
