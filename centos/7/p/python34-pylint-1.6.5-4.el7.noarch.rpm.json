            "Description": "\nPylint is a Python source code analyzer which looks for programming\nerrors, helps enforcing a coding standard and sniffs for some code\nsmells (as defined in Martin Fowler's Refactoring book).\nPylint can be seen as another PyChecker since nearly all tests you\ncan do with PyChecker can also be done with Pylint. However, Pylint\noffers some more features, like checking length of lines of code,\nchecking if variable names are well-formed according to your coding\nstandard, or checking if declared interfaces are truly implemented,\nand much more.\nAdditionally, it is possible to write plugins to add your own checks.\n",
