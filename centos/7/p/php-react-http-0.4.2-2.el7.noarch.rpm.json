Here\nare the main concepts:\n\n* Server: Attaches itself to an instance of React\\Socket\\ServerInterface,\n      parses any incoming data as HTTP, emits a request event for each request.\n* Request: A ReadableStream which streams the request body and contains meta\n      data which was parsed from the request header.\n* Response A WritableStream which streams the response body. You can set the\n      status code and response headers via the writeHead() method.\n\nAutoloader: /usr/share/php/React/Http/autoload.php\n",
