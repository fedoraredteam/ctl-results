The module is designed for Perl 5.006 and\nithreads (and higher), but can work with fork() and Perl 5.004.\n\nThe Net::Daemon class offers methods for the most common tasks a daemon\nneeds: Starting up, logging, accepting clients, authorization, restricting\nits own environment for security and doing the true work. You only have to\noverride those methods that aren't appropriate for you, but typically\ninheriting will safe you a lot of work anyways.\n",
