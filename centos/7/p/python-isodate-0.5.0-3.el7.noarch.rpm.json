            "Description": "\nThis module implements ISO 8601 date, time and duration parsing. The\nimplementation follows ISO8601:2004 standard, and implements only date/time\nrepresentations mentioned in the standard. If something is not mentioned there,\nthen it is treated as non existent, and not as an allowed option.\n\nFor instance, ISO8601:2004 never mentions 2 digit years. So, it is not intended\nby this module to support 2 digit years. (while it may still be valid as ISO\ndate, because it is not explicitly forbidden.) Another example is, when no time\nzone information is given for a time, then it should be interpreted as local\ntime, and not UTC.\n\nAs this module maps ISO 8601 dates/times to standard Python data types, like\ndate, time, datetime and timedelta, it is not possible to convert all possible\nISO 8601 dates/times. For instance, dates before 0001-01-01 are not allowed by\nthe Python date and datetime classes. Additionally fractional seconds are\nlimited to microseconds. That means if the parser finds for instance\nnanoseconds it will round it to microseconds.\n",
