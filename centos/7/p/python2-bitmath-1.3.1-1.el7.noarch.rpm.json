            "Description": "\nbitmath simplifies many facets of interacting with file sizes in\nvarious units. Examples include: converting between SI and NIST prefix\nunits (GiB to kB), converting between units of the same type (SI to\nSI, or NIST to NIST), basic arithmetic operations (subtracting 42KiB\nfrom 50GiB), and rich comparison operations (1024 Bytes == 1KiB),\nbitwise operations, sorting, automatic best human-readable prefix\nselection, and completely customizable formatting.\n\nIn addition to the conversion and math operations, bitmath provides\nhuman readable representations of values which are suitable for use in\ninteractive shells as well as larger scripts and applications. It can\nalso read the capacity of system storage devices. bitmath can parse\nstrings (like \"1 KiB\") into proper objects and has support for\nintegration with the argparse module as a custom argument type and the\nprogressbar module as a custom file transfer speed widget.\n\nbitmath is thoroughly unittested, with almost 200 individual tests (a\nnumber which is always increasing). bitmath's test-coverage is almost\nalways at 100%.\n",
