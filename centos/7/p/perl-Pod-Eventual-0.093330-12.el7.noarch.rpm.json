            "Description": "\nPOD is a pretty simple format to write, but it can be a big pain to deal\nwith reading it and doing anything useful with it. Most existing POD\nparsers care about semantics, like whether a =item occurred after an\n=over but before a back, figuring out how to link a L<>, and other things\nlike that.\n\nPod::Eventual is much less ambitious and much more stupid. Fortunately, stupid\nis often better. (That's what I keep telling myself, anyway.)\n\nPod::Eventual reads line-based input and produces events describing each POD\nparagraph or directive it finds. Once complete events are immediately passed to\nthe handle_event method. This method should be implemented by Pod::Eventual\nsub-classes. If it isn't, Pod::Eventual's own handle_event will be called, and\nwill raise an exception.\n",
