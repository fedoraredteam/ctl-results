This leads to\nsome interesting naming schemes for test files to get them in the desired\norder.\n\nYou can specify any order or any files that you like, though, with the test\ndirective to WriteMakefile.\n\nTest::Manifest looks in the t/test_manifest file to find out which tests you\nwant to run and the order in which you want to run them. It constructs the\nright value for MakeMaker to do the right thing.\n",
