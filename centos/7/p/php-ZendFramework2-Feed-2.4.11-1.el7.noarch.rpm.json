It provides\na natural syntax for accessing elements of feeds, feed attributes, and entry\nattributes. Zend\\Feed also has extensive support for modifying feed and entry\nstructure with the same natural syntax, and turning the result back into XML.\nIn the future, this modification support could provide support for the Atom\nPublishing Protocol.\n\nZend\\Feed consists of Zend\\Feed\\Reader for reading RSS and Atom feeds,\nZend\\Feed\\Writer for writing RSS and Atom feeds, and Zend\\Feed\\PubSubHubbub\nfor working with Hub servers. Furthermore, both Zend\\Feed\\Reader and\nZend\\Feed\\Writer support extensions which allows for working with additional\ndata in feeds, not covered in the core API but used in conjunction with RSS\nand Atom feeds.\n",
