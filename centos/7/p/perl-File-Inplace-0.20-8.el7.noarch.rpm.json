Inspired by variations of perl's -i option, this module is\nintended for somewhat more structured and reusable editing than command\nline perl typically allows. File::Inplace endeavors to guarantee file\nintegrity; that is, either all of the changes made will be saved to the\nfile, or none will. It also offers functionality such as backup creation,\nautomatic field splitting per-line, automatic chomping/unchomping, and\naborting edits partially through without affecting the original file.\n",
