            "Description": "\nModule::Build is a system for building, testing, and installing Perl\nmodules. It is meant to be an alternative to ExtUtils::MakeMaker.\nDevelopers may alter the behavior of the module through sub-classing in a\nmuch more straightforward way than with MakeMaker. It also does not require\na make on your system - most of the Module::Build code is pure-perl and\nwritten in a very cross-platform way. In fact, you don't even need a shell,\nso even platforms like MacOS (traditional) can use it fairly easily. Its\nonly prerequisites are modules that are included with perl 5.6.0, and it\nworks fine on perl 5.005 if you can install a few additional modules.\n",
