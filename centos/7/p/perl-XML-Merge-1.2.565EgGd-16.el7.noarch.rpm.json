            "Description": "\nThis module inherits from XML::Tidy which in turn inherits from XML::XPath.\nThis ensures that Merge objects' indenting can be tidied up after any merge\noperation since such modification usually spells the ruination of indentation.\nPolymorphism allows Merge objects to be utilized as normal XML::XPath objects\nas well.\nThe merging behavior is setup to combine separate XML documents according to\ncertain rules and configurable options. If both documents have root nodes which\nare elements of the same name, the documents are merged directly. Otherwise,\none is merged as a child of the other. An optional XPath location can be\nspecified as the place to perform the merge. If no location is specified, the\nmerge is attempted at the first matching element or is appended as the new last\nchild of the other root if no match is found.\n",
