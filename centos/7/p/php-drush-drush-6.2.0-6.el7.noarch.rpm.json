If\nyou are unfamiliar with shell scripting, reviewing the documentation for your\nshell (e.g. man bash) or reading an online tutorial (e.g. search for \"bash\ntutorial\") will help you get the most out of Drush.\n\nDrush core ships with lots of useful commands for interacting with code like\nmodules/themes/profiles. Similarly, it runs update.php, executes sql queries\nand DB migrations, and misc utilities like run cron or clear cache.\n\nWorks with Drupal 6, Drupal 7, and usually Drupal 8.\n\nNOTE: You must manually install your required database driver\n      (ex: php-mysql, php-mysqli, php-pgsql)\n",
