Things like ANSI terminal coloring, capturing\ncolored output from programs using sub-process, or even a simple logging system\nwhich provides some nice functionality over the built-in Python logging system.\n\nThe functionality provided here should be generic enough to be reused in\narbitrary scenarios and should avoid bringing in dependencies which are not\npart of the standard Python library. Where possible Windows and Linux/OS X\nshould be supported, and where it cannot it should be gracefully degrading.\n",
