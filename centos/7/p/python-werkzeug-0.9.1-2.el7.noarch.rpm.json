It includes a powerful debugger, full featured request and\nresponse objects, HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache control\nheaders, HTTP dates, cookie handling, file uploads, a powerful URL\nrouting system and a bunch of community contributed addon modules.\n\nWerkzeug is unicode aware and doesn't enforce a specific template\nengine, database adapter or anything else.  It doesn't even enforce\na specific way of handling requests and leaves all that up to the\ndeveloper. It's most useful for end user applications which should work\non as many server environments as possible (such as blogs, wikis,\nbulletin boards, etc.).\n",
