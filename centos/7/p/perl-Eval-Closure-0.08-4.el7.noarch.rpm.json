            "Description": "\nString eval is often used for dynamic code generation. For instance, Moose uses\nit heavily, to generate inlined versions of accessors and constructors, which\nspeeds code up at runtime by a significant amount. String eval is not without\nits issues however - it's difficult to control the scope it's used in (which\ndetermines which variables are in scope inside the eval), and it's easy to miss\ncompilation errors, since eval catches them and sticks them in $@ instead.\n\nThis module attempts to solve these problems. It provides an eval_closure\nfunction, which evals a string in a clean environment, other than a fixed list\nof specified variables. Compilation errors are rethrown automatically.\n",
