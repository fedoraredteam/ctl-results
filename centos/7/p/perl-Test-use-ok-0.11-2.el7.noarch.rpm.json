            "Description": "\nAccording to the Test::More documentation, it is recommended to run\nuse_ok() inside a BEGIN block, so functions are exported at compile-time\nand prototypes are properly honored.\n\nHowever, people often either forget to add \"BEGIN\", or mistakenly group\n\"use_ok\" with other tests in a single \"BEGIN\" block, which can create\nsubtle differences in execution order.\n\nWith this module, simply change all \"use_ok\" in test scripts to \"use ok\",\nand they will be executed at \"BEGIN\" time. The explicit space after \"use\"\nmakes it clear that this is a single compile-time action.\n",
