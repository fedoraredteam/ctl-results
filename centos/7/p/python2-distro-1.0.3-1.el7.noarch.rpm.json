An alternative implementation became necessary because\nPython 3.5 deprecated this function, and Python 3.7 is expected to remove it\naltogether. Its predecessor function platform.dist was already deprecated since\nPython 2.6 and is also expected to be removed in Python 3.7. Still, there are\nmany cases in which access to that information is needed. See Python issue 1322\nfor more information.\n\nPython 2 version.\n",
