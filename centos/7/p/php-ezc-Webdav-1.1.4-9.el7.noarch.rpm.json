The current implementation is compatible with\nRFC 2518 and realizes most parts of the changes defined in RFC 4918. It also\nsupports clients that do not conform to the standard and provides an interface\nto support these clients.\n\nThe component is intended to support you by providing access to your data\nthrough the HTTP 1.1 protocol. The data can be stored in the file system, or\nany other custom data storage. It is then served as a virtual directory tree to\nthe user.\n",
