It allows to keep a database\nhandle to maintain a connection in order to minimize overhead without\nhaving to worry about dropped or corrupted connections.\n\nBorrowing an interface from DBIx::Class, DBIx::Connector also offers\nan API that handles the scoping of database transactions. In addition,\nit offers an API for savepoints if a database supports them.\n",
