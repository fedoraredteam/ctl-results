It allows you to use a single, clean Python 3.x-compatible\ncodebase to support both Python 2 and Python 3 with minimal overhead.\n\nIt provides ``future`` and ``past`` packages with backports and forward\nports of features from Python 3 and 2. It also comes with ``futurize`` and\n``pasteurize``, customized 2to3-based scripts that helps you to convert\neither Py2 or Py3 code easily to support both Python 2 and 3 in a single\nclean Py3-style codebase, module by module.\n",
