Since much\nof what PHP does is web-based, specifically HTTP, it makes sense to have a\nperformant, extensible, concise and consistent API to do all things HTTP.\nIn nutshell, there are several parts of Zend\\Http:\n\n* Context-less Request and Response classes that expose a fluent API for\n  introspecting several aspects of HTTP messages:\n  ** Request line information and response status information\n  ** Parameters, such as those found in POST and GET\n  ** Message Body\n  ** Headers\n* A Client implementation with various adapters that allow for sending requests\n  and introspecting responses.\n",
