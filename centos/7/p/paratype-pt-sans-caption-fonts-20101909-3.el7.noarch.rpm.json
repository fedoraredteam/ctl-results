This project aims at enabling the peoples of Russia to\nread and write their native languages, using free/libre fonts. It is\ndedicated to the 300-year anniversary of the Russian civil type invented by\nPeter the Great from 1708 to 1710, and was realized with financial support\nfrom the Russian Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications.\n\nThe fonts include support for all 54 title\u00b9 languages of the Russian\nFederation as well as more common Western, Central European and Cyrillic\nblocks making them unique and a very important tool for modern digital\ncommunications.\n\nPT Sans is a grotesque font based on Russian type designs of the second part\nof the 20th century. However, it also includes very distinctive features of\nmodern humanistic design, fulfilling present day aesthetic and functional\nrequirements.\n\nIt was designed by Alexandra Korolkova, Olga Umpeleva and Vladimir Yefimov\nand released by ParaType.\n\n\u00b9 A \u201ctitle\u201d language is named after an ethnic group.\n\nThis package includes 2 captions styles for small text sizes.\n",
