            "Description": "\nA caching API built around the concept of a \"dogpile lock\", which allows\ncontinued access to an expiring data value while a single thread generates\na new value.\n\ndogpile.cache builds on the `dogpile.core\n<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dogpile.core>`_ locking system, which\nimplements the idea of \"allow one creator to write while others read\" in\nthe abstract.   Overall, dogpile.cache is intended as a replacement to the\n`Beaker <http://beaker.groovie.org>`_ caching system, the internals of\nwhich are written by the same author.   All the ideas of Beaker which\n\"work\" are re-implemented in dogpile.cache in a more efficient and succinct\nmanner, and all the cruft (Beaker's internals were first written in 2005)\nrelegated to the trash heap.\n",
