(The file test may also be a \"cd\", causing subsequent relative file\nnames to be interpreted relative to that directory.) After the file test you\nmay put || die to make it a fatal error if the file test fails. The default is\n|| warn.  The file test may optionally have a \"!' prepended to test for the\nopposite condition. If you do a cd and then list some relative file names, you\nmay want to indent them slightly for readability. If you supply your own die()\nor warn() message, you can use $file to interpolate the file name.\n",
