It includes some ideas\nfrom other implementations and previous concepts like nodeXchange and SNDX.\n\nSome advantages of using CNML is that it allows to uncouple different\nfunctionalities independently of the web application used to show the data,\nreducing dependence from it and its internal tables of the database.\n",
