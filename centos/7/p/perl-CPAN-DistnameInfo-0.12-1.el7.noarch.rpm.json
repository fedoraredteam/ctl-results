            "Description": "\nMany online services that are centered around CPAN attempt to\nassociate multiple uploads by extracting a distribution name from the\nfilename of the upload. For most distributions this is easy as they\nhave used ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Module::Build to create the\ndistribution, which results in a uniform name. But sadly not all\nuploads are created in this way.\n\nCPAN::DistnameInfo uses heuristics that have been learnt by\nhttp://search.cpan.org/ to extract the distribution name and version\nfrom filenames and also report if the version is to be treated as a\ndeveloper release.\n",
