Plumbum (Latin for lead,\nwhich was used to create pipes back in the day) is a small yet feature-rich\nlibrary for shell script-like programs in Python. The motto of the library is\n\"Never write shell scripts again\", and thus it attempts to mimic the shell\nsyntax (\"shell combinators\") where it makes sense, while keeping it all\npythonic and cross-platform.\n",
