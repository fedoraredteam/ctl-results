            "Description": "\nThe purpose of this library was to replace our dependence on Unix epoch time,\nwhich, being limited to a range of about 1970 to 2030, is inadequate for our\npurposes (we have data as old as 1870). This date library effectively handles\ndates from A.D. 1000 to infinity, and would probably work all the way back to 0\n(ignoring, of course, the switch-over to the Gregorian calendar). The useful\nfeatures of Unix epoch time (ease of date difference calculation and date\ncomparison, strict ordering) are preserved, and elements such as\nhuman-legibility are added. The library handles fractional seconds and some\ndate/time manipulations used for the Global Positioning Satellite system.\n",
