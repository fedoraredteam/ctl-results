It is intended to be used in situations where a\nproject wants to mimic the command-line flag handling of a C++ app that uses\ngoogle-gflags, or for a Python app that, via swig or some other means, is\nlinked with a C++ app that uses google-gflags.\n\nThe gflags package contains a library that implements commandline flags\nprocessing. As such it's a replacement for getopt(). It has increased\nflexibility, including built-in support for Python types, and the ability to\ndefine flags in the source file in which they're used. (This last is its major\ndifference from OptParse.)\n",
