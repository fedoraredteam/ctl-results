The nutshell version of how this works is that default installation\nlocations are determined from ExtUtils::Config, and they may be individually\noverridden by using the install_path attribute. An install_base attribute lets\nyou specify an alternative installation root like /home/foo and prefix does\nsomething similar in a rather different (and more complicated) way. destdir\nlets you specify a temporary installation directory like /tmp/install in case\nyou want to create bundled-up installable packages.\n",
