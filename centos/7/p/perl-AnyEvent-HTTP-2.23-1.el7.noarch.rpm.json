It can follow redirects supports proxies and\nautomatically limits the number of connections to the values specified\nin the RFC.\n\nIt should generally be a \"good client\" that is enough for most HTTP\ntasks. Simple tasks should be simple, but complex tasks should still be\npossible as the user retains control over request and response headers.\n\nThe caller is responsible for authentication management, cookies (if the\nsimplistic implementation in this module doesn't suffice), referrer and\nother high-level protocol details for which this module offers only\nlimited support.\n",
