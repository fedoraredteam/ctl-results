            "Description": "\nDigest::BubbleBabble takes a message digest (generated by either of the MD5 or\nSHA-1 message digest algorithms) and creates a fingerprint of that digest in\n\"bubble babble\" format. Bubble babble is a method of representing a message\ndigest as a string of \"real\" words, to make the fingerprint easier to remember.\nThe \"words\" are not necessarily real words, but they look more like words than\na string of hex characters.\n\nBubble babble fingerprinting is used by the SSH2 suite (and, consequently, by\nNet::SSH::Perl, the Perl SSH implementation) to display easy-to-remember key\nfingerprints. The key (a DSA or RSA key) is converted into a textual form,\ndigested using Digest::SHA1, and run through bubblebabble to create the key\nfingerprint.\n",
