            "Description": "\nMany modern text editors automatically save files using UTF-8 codification.\nHowever, the perl interpreter does not expect it by default. Whilst this does\nnot represent a big deal on (most) backend-oriented programs, Web framework\n(Catalyst, Mojolicious) based applications will suffer so-called Mojibake\n(literally: \"unintelligible sequence of characters\"). Even worse: if an editor\nsaves BOM (Byte Order Mark, U+FEFF character in Unicode) at the start of a\nscript with the executable bit set (on Unix systems), it won't execute at all,\ndue to shebang corruption.\n\nAvoiding codification problems is quite simple:\n\n * Always use utf8/use common::sense when saving source as UTF-8\n * Always specify =encoding utf8 when saving POD as UTF-8\n * Do neither of above when saving as ISO-8859-1\n * Never save BOM (not that it's wrong; just avoid it as you'll barely\n   notice its presence when in trouble)\n\nHowever, if you find yourself upgrading old code to use UTF-8 or trying to\nstandardize a big project with many developers, each one using a different\nplatform/editor, reviewing all files manually can be quite painful, especially\nin cases where some files have multiple encodings (note: it all started when I\nrealized that gedit and derivatives are unable to open files with character\nconversion tables).\n\nEnter the Test::Mojibake ;)\n",
