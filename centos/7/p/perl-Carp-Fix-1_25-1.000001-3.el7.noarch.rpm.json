            "Description": "\nCarp 1.25 made a change to its formatting, adding a period at the end of the\nmessage. This can mess up tests and code that are looking for error messages.\nCarp::Fix::1_25 makes the message consistent, regardless of what version of\nCarp you're using.\n\nCarp::Fix::1_25 exports its own carp functions, which change the Carp message\nto match the 1.25 version. Carp::Fix::1_25 otherwise acts exactly like Carp and\nit will honor Carp global variables such as @CARP_NOT and %Carp::Internal.\n\nWhy do this instead of just upgrading Carp? Upgrading Carp would affect all\ninstalled code all at once. You might not be ready for that, or you might not\nwant your module to foist that on its users. This lets you fix things one\nnamespace at a time.\n",
