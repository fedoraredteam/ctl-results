            "Description": "\nZend\\Log\\Logger is a component for general purpose logging. It supports multiple\nlog backends, formatting messages sent to the log, and filtering messages from\nbeing logged. These functions are divided into the following objects:\n\n* A Logger (instance of Zend\\Log\\Logger) is the object that your application\n  uses the most. You can have as many Logger objects as you like; they do not\n  interact. A Logger object must contain at least one Writer, and can optionally\n  contain one or more Filters.\n* A Writer (inherits from Zend\\Log\\Writer\\AbstractWriter) is responsible for\n  saving data to storage.\n* A Filter (implements Zend\\Log\\Filter\\FilterInterface) blocks log data from\n  being saved. A filter is applied to an individual writer. Filters can be\n  chained.\n* A Formatter (implements Zend\\Log\\Formatter\\FormatterInterface) can format the\n  log data before it is written by a Writer. Each Writer has exactly one\n  Formatter.\n\nOptional: MongoDB (php-pecl-mongo)\n",
