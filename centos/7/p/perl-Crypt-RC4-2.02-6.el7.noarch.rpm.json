Here is the description from RSA's website:\n\nRC4 is a stream cipher designed by Rivest for RSA Data Security (now RSA\nSecurity). It is a variable key-size stream cipher with byte-oriented\noperations. The algorithm is based on the use of a random permutation. Analysis\nshows that the period of the cipher is overwhelmingly likely to be greater than\n10100. Eight to sixteen machine operations are required per output byte, and\nthe cipher can be expected to run very quickly in software. Independent analysts\nhave scrutinized the algorithm and it is considered secure.\n",
