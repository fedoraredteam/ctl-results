            "Description": "\nExtUtils::XSBuilder is a set of modules to parse C header files and create\nXS glue code and documentation out of it. Ideally this allows one to \"write\"\nan interface to a C library without coding a line. Since no C-API is ideal,\nsome adjuments are necessary most of the time. So to use this module you\nmust still be familiar with C and XS programming, but it removes a lot of\nstupid work and copy&paste from you. Also when the C API changes, most\nof the time you only have to rerun XSBuilder to get your new Perl API.\n",
