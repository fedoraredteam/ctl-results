            "Description": "\nThe Zend\\Permissions\\Acl component provides a lightweight and flexible access\ncontrol list (ACL) implementation for privileges management. In general, an\napplication may utilize such ACL\u2018s to control access to certain protected\nobjects by other requesting objects.\n\nFor the purposes of this documentation:\n\n* a resource is an object to which access is controlled.\n* a role is an object that may request access to a Resource.\n\nPut simply, roles request access to resources. For example, if a parking\nattendant requests access to a car, then the parking attendant is the requesting\nrole, and the car is the resource, since access to the car may not be granted\nto everyone.\n\nThrough the specification and use of an ACL, an application may control how\nroles are granted access to resources.\n",
