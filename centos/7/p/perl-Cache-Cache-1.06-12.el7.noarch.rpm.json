Often these modules are used in web applications to\nstore data locally to save repeated and redundant expensive calls to remote\nmachines or databases.  People have also been known to use Cache::Cache for\nits straightforward interface in sharing data between runs of an application\nor invocations of a CGI-style script or simply as an easy to use abstraction\nof the filesystem or shared memory.\n",
