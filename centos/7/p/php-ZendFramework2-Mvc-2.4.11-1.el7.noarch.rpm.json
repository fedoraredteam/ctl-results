The ServiceManager creates and\n  configures your application instance and workflow.\n* Zend\\EventManager - The MVC is event driven. This component is used everywhere\n  from initial bootstrapping of the application, through returning response and\n  request calls, to setting and retrieving routes and matched routes, as well as\n  render views.\n* Zend\\Http - specifically the request and response objects.\n* Zend\\Stdlib\\DispatchableInterface. All \u201ccontrollers\u201d are simply dispatchable\n  objects.\n",
