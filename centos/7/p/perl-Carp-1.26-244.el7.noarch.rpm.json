In the case of cluck, confess, and longmess that\ncontext is a summary of every call in the call-stack. For a shorter message\nyou can use carp or croak which report the error as being from where your\nmodule was called. There is no guarantee that that is where the error was,\nbut it is a good educated guess.\n",
