Then when you run your tests again, they all\njust hit the text files instead of the internet.  This speeds up your tests and\nlets you work offline.\n\nIf the server you are testing against ever changes its API, all you need to do\nis delete your existing cassette files, and run your tests again.  All of the\nmocked responses will be updated with the new API.\n",
