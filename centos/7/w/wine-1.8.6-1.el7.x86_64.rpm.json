This\npackage includes a program loader, which allows unmodified Windows\n3.x/9x/NT binaries to run on x86 and x86_64 Unixes. Wine can use native system\n.dll files if they are available.\n\nIn Fedora wine is a meta-package which will install everything needed for wine\nto work smoothly. Smaller setups can be achieved by installing some of the\nwine-* sub packages.\n",
