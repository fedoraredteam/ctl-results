            "Description": "\nwithlock is a locking wrapper script to make sure that some program\nisn't run more than once. It is ideal to prevent periodic jobs spawned\nby cron from stacking up.\n\nThe locks created are valid only while the wrapper is running, and\nthus will never require additional cleanup, even after a reboot. This\nmakes the wrapper safe and easy to use, and much better than\nimplementing half-hearted locking within scripts.\n",
