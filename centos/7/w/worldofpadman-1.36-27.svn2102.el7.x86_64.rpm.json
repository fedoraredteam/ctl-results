            "Description": "\nWorld of Padman (WoP) is a first-person shooter computer game available in\nboth English and German. The idea is based on the Padman comic strip for the\nmagazine PlayStation Games created by the professional cartoon artist Andreas\n'ENTE' Endres, who is also the man who made many of the maps included with the\ngame in 1998. Most of the maps in the game are lilliput style.\n\nWorld of Padman uses the GPL licensed ioquake3 engine, however the Wop data-\nfiles are not freely redistributable. This package will install a World of\nPadman menu entry, which will automatically download the necessary datafiles\n(1GB!) the first time you start World of Padman.\n",
