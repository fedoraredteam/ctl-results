It determines\nwhich packages have no other packages depending on their installation,\nand shows you a list of these packages.  It intends to be clone of\ndeborphan Debian tools for rpm packages.\n\nIt will try to help you to remove unused packages, for example:\n* after a distribution upgrade\n* when you want to suppress packages after some tests\n\nSeveral tools are also provided :\n* rpmusage - display rpm packages last use date\n* rpmdep - display the full dependency of an installed rpm package\n* rpmduplicates - find programs with several version installed\n\nYum offers a program called 'package-cleanup' which you can use to\ncarry out similar tasks.\n\n[1] Note that orphan is used in the sense of Debian's deborphan, and\nis NOT the same as Fedora orphaned packages which are packages that\nhave no current maintainer.\n",
