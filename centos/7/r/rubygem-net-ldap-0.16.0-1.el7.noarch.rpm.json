Net::LDAP is written completely in\nRuby with no external dependencies. It supports most LDAP client features and\na subset of server features as well.\nNet::LDAP has been tested against modern popular LDAP servers including\nOpenLDAP and Active Directory. The current release is mostly compliant with\nearlier versions of the IETF LDAP RFCs (2251\u20132256, 2829\u20132830, 3377, and\n3771).\nOur roadmap for Net::LDAP 1.0 is to gain full client compliance with\nthe most recent LDAP RFCs (4510\u20134519, plus portions of 4520\u20134532).\n",
