It also determines what user accounts are being targeted. It\nkeeps track of the frequency of attempts from each host and, upon\ndiscovering a repeated attack host, updates the /etc/hosts.deny file\nto prevent future break-in attempts from that host.  Email reports can\nbe sent to a system admin.\n",
