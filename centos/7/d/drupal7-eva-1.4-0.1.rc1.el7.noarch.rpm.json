            "Description": "\n\"Eva\" is short for \"Entity Views Attachment;\" it provides a Views display plugin\nthat allows the output of a View to be attached to the content of any Drupal\nentity. The body of a node or comment, the profile of a user account, or the\nlisting page for a Taxonomy term are all examples of entity content.\n\nThe placement of the view in the entity's content can be reordered on the\n\"Field Display\" administration page for that entity, like other fields added\nusing the Field UI module.\n\nIn addition, the unique ID of the entity the view is attached to -- as well as\nany tokens generated from that entity -- can be passed in as arguments to the\nview. For example, you might make a View that displays posts with an 'Author ID'\nargument, then use Eva to attach the view to the User entity type. When a user\nprofile is displayed, the User's ID will be passed in as the argument to the\nview magically.\n",
