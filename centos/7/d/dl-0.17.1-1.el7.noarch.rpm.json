The ticket is\nautomatically expired according to the specified rules, so that you don't need\nto keep track or cleanup afterward. dl also allows you to grant an anonymous,\none-time upload for others to send *you* a file, without the requirement of\naccount management.\n\ndl is usually installed as a \"email attachments replacement\" due to its\nsimplicity (though can be used in other ways).\n",
