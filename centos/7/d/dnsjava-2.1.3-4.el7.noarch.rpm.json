            "Description": "\ndnsjava is an implementation of DNS in Java. It supports all of the common\nrecord types and the DNSSEC types. It can be used for queries, zone transfers,\nand dynamic updates. It includes a cache which can be used by clients, and a\nminimal implementation of a server. It supports TSIG authenticated messages,\npartial DNSSEC verification, and EDNS0.\n\ndnsjava provides functionality above and beyond that of the InetAddress class.\nSince it is written in pure Java, dnsjava is fully threadable, and in many\ncases is faster than using InetAddress.\n\ndnsjava provides both high and low level access to DNS. The high level\nfunctions perform queries for records of a given name, type, and class, and\nreturn an array of records. There is also a clone of InetAddress, which is\neven simpler. A cache is used to reduce the number of DNS queries sent. The\nlow level functions allow direct manipulation of dns messages and records, as\nwell as allowing additional resolver properties to be set.\n\nA 'dig' clone and a dynamic update program are included, as well as a\nprimary-only server.\n",
