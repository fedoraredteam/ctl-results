At its core it is a drag and drop content manager that lets you\nvisually design a layout and place content within that layout. Integration with\nother systems allows you to create nodes that use this, landing pages that use\nthis, and even override system pages such as taxonomy and the node page so that\nyou can customize the layout of your site with very fine grained permissions.\n\nThis package provides the following Drupal modules:\n* panels\n* panels_ipe\n* panels_mini\n* panels_node\n* i18n_panels\n",
