The translation can be done\nby people or translation services of all kinds. It builds on and uses\nexisting language tools and data structures in Drupal and can be used\nin automated workflow scenarios.\n\nThis module does not make i18n or any other language module for Drupal\nobsolete. It does only facilitate the translation process.\n\nThe second alpha has been released, huge improvements have been made\n(see the release notes for details) and there's even more work to do.\nPlease test the new version and report any bugs that you can find.\n\nImportant: The external translator plugins (Microsoft, MyGengo, Nativy,\nSupertext) have been moved to separate projects. When any of these plugins,\nmake sure to download them as well and then run update.php when updating.\n\nThis package provides the following Drupal modules:\n* tmgmt\n* tmgmt_entity\n* tmgmt_entity_ui\n* tmgmt_field\n* tmgmt_file\n* tmgmt_i18n_string\n* tmgmt_language_combination\n* tmgmt_local\n* tmgmt_locale\n* tmgmt_node\n* tmgmt_node_ui\n* tmgmt_ui\n",
