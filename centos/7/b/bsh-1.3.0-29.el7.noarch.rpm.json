            "Description": "\nBeanShell is a small, free, embeddable, Java source interpreter with\nobject scripting language features, written in Java.  BeanShell\nexecutes standard Java statements and expressions, in addition to\nobvious scripting commands and syntax.  BeanShell supports scripted\nobjects as simple method closures like those in Perl and\nJavaScript(tm).  You can use BeanShell interactively for Java\nexperimentation and debugging or as a simple scripting engine for your\napplications.  In short: BeanShell is a dynamically interpreted Java,\nplus some useful stuff.  Another way to describe it is to say that in\nmany ways BeanShell is to Java as Tcl/Tk is to C: BeanShell is\nembeddable - You can call BeanShell from your Java applications to\nexecute Java code dynamically at run-time or to provide scripting\nextensibility for your applications.  Alternatively, you can call your\nJava applications and objects from BeanShell; working with Java\nobjects and APIs dynamically.  Since BeanShell is written in Java and\nruns in the same space as your application, you can freely pass\nreferences to \"real live\" objects into scripts and return them as\nresults.\n",
