            "Description": "\nThe purpose of beets is to get your music collection right once and for all. It\ncatalogs your collection, automatically improving its meta-data as it goes using\nthe MusicBrainz database. Then it provides a bouquet of tools for manipulating\nand accessing your music.\nBecause beets is designed as a library, it can do almost anything you can\nimagine for your music collection. Via plugins, beets becomes a panacea:\n- Fetch or calculate all the meta-data you could possibly need: album art,\n  lyrics, genres, tempos, ReplayGain levels, or acoustic fingerprints.\n- Get meta-data from MusicBrainz, Discogs, or Beatport. Or guess meta-data using\n  songs' file names or their acoustic fingerprints.\n- Transcode audio to any format you like.\n- Check your library for duplicate tracks and albums or for albums that are\n  missing tracks.\n- Browse your music library graphically through a Web browser and play it in\n  any browser that supports HTML5 Audio.\n",
