In 1628 Georgian printing\ntypes were produced for the first time, in Rome. The \"Georgian-Italian\nDictionary\"  and \"Georgian Prayers\" were printed in Rome, 1629, by Stephano\nPaolini and Nikiphore Irbach (Irubakhidze-Cholokashvili). In 1643, in Rome,\n\"Georgian Grammar\" by Francisco-Maria Majio was printed, using Nuskhuri,\nAsomtavruli and Mkhedruli. Majio spent 7 years in Georgia studying Georgian\nlanguage, scripture and grammar. Font \"BPG Irubaqidze\" is a modernized\nreplica of this casted type.\n",
