The injected code is allowed to access any of your data\nand call any application methods, including where they are private.\nYou can inject code almost anywhere you want and there is no need to\nprepare the original source code in advance nor do you have to recompile,\nrepackage or redeploy your application. In fact you can remove injected\ncode and reinstall different code while the application continues to execute.\n",
