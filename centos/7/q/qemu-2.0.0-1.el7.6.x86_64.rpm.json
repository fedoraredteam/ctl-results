QEMU has two operating modes:\n\n * Full system emulation. In this mode, QEMU emulates a full system (for\n   example a PC), including a processor and various peripherials. It can be\n   used to launch different Operating Systems without rebooting the PC or\n   to debug system code.\n * User mode emulation. In this mode, QEMU can launch Linux processes compiled\n   for one CPU on another CPU.\n\nAs QEMU requires no host kernel patches to run, it is safe and easy to use.\n",
