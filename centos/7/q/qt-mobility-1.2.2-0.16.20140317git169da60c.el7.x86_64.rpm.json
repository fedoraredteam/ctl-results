However, these APIs\nallow the developer to use these features with ease from one framework and apply\nthem to phones, netbooks and non-mobile personal computers. The framework not\nonly improves many aspects of a mobile experience, because it improves the use\nof these technologies, but has applicability beyond the mobile device arena.\n",
