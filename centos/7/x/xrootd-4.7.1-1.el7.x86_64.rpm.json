However, the server is agnostic to file types and\nprovides POSIX-like access to any type of file.\n\nThe cmsd server is the next generation version of the olbd server,\noriginally developed to cluster and load balance Objectivity/DB AMS\ndatabase servers. It provides enhanced capability along with lower\nlatency and increased throughput.\n",
