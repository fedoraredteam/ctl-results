            "Description": "\nA stream buffer is a stream-based representation of an XML\ninfo-set in Java. Stream buffers are designed to: provide\nvery efficient stream-based memory representations of XML\ninfo-sets; and be created and processed using any Java-based\nXML API.\nConceptually a stream buffer is similar to the representation\nused in the Xerces deferred DOM implementation, with the crucial\ndifference that a stream buffer does not store hierarchical\ninformation like parent and sibling information. The deferred\nDOM implementation reduces memory usage when large XML documents\nare parsed but only a subset of the document needs to be processed.\n(Note that using deferred DOM will be more expensive than\nnon-deferred DOM in terms of memory and processing if all\nthe document is traversed.)\nStream buffers may be used as an efficient alternative to DOM where:\n* most or all of an XML info-set will eventually get traversed; and/or\n* targeted access to certain parts of an XML info-set are required\n and need to be efficiently processed using stream-based APIs like\n SAX or StAX.\n",
