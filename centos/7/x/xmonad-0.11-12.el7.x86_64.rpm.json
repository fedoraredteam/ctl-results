All features of the window manager are accessible from\nthe keyboard: a mouse is strictly optional. xmonad is written and\nextensible in Haskell. Custom layout algorithms, and other\nextensions, may be written by the user in config files. Layouts are\napplied dynamically, and different layouts may be used on each\nworkspace. Xinerama is fully supported, allowing windows to be tiled\non several screens.\n\nThis is a meta-package that installs xmonad-basic and ghc-xmonad-contrib-devel,\nallowing xmonad to be customized with \"~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs\".\n\nTo use xmonad with GNOME/MATE, please install xmonad-mate.\n",
