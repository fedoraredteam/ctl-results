            "Description": "\nThe h5py package provides both a high- and low-level interface to the\nHDF5 library from Python. The low-level interface is intended to be a\ncomplete wrapping of the HDF5 API, while the high-level component\nsupports access to HDF5 files, data sets and groups using established\nPython and NumPy concepts.\n\nA strong emphasis on automatic conversion between Python (Numpy)\ndata types and data structures and their HDF5 equivalents vastly\nsimplifies the process of reading and writing data from Python.\n",
