Here are some primitive tools to help you\nmanage your graphite clusters.\n\nAll of the tools support two common arguments; the path to a config file, and\nthe name of the cluster. Using these tools alongside a config file that\ndescribes your graphite clusters you can build up scripts to manage your\nmetrics. Some of the tools could easily be replaced with one-liners in shell,\nbut exist here for convenience and readability. The goal is to provide fast,\npredictable utilities that can easily be composed into more advanced tooling.\n",
