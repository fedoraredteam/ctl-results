            "Description": "\nCryptlib is a powerful security toolkit that allows even inexperienced crypto\nprogrammers to easily add encryption and authentication services to their\nsoftware. The high-level interface provides anyone with the ability to add\nstrong security capabilities to an application in as little as half an hour,\nwithout needing to know any of the low-level details that make the encryption\nor authentication work.  Because of this, cryptlib dramatically reduces the\ncost involved in adding security to new or existing applications.\n\nAt the highest level, cryptlib provides implementations of complete security\nservices such as S/MIME and PGP/OpenPGP secure enveloping, SSL/TLS and\nSSH secure sessions, CA services such as CMP, SCEP, RTCS, and OCSP, and other\nsecurity operations such as secure time-stamping. Since cryptlib uses\nindustry-standard X.509, S/MIME, PGP/OpenPGP, and SSH/SSL/TLS data formats,\nthe resulting encrypted or signed data can be easily transported to other\nsystems and processed there, and cryptlib itself runs on virtually any\noperating system - cryptlib doesn't tie you to a single system.\nThis allows email, files and EDI transactions to be authenticated with\ndigital signatures and encrypted in an industry-standard format.\n",
