            "Description": "\nCoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript. Underneath all\nof those embarrassing braces and semicolons, JavaScript has always had a\ngorgeous object model at its heart. CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the\ngood parts of JavaScript in a simple way.\n\nThe golden rule of CoffeeScript is: \"It's just JavaScript\". The code compiles\none-to-one into the equivalent JS, and there is no interpretation at runtime.\nYou can use any existing JavaScript library seamlessly (and vice-versa). The\ncompiled output is readable and pretty-printed, passes through JavaScript Lint\nwithout warnings, will work in every JavaScript implementation, and tends to run\nas fast or faster than the equivalent handwritten JavaScript.\n",
