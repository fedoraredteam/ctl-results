Biniou is vastly equivalent to JSON in terms of functionality\nbut allows implementations several times faster (4 times faster than\nyojson), with 25-35% space savings.\n\nBiniou data can be decoded into human-readable form without knowledge\nof type definitions except for field and variant names which are\nrepresented by 31-bit hashes. A program named bdump is provided for\nroutine visualization of biniou data files.\n",
