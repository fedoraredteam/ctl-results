            "Description": "\nObjenesis is a small Java library that serves one purpose: to instantiate\na new object of a particular class.\nJava supports dynamic instantiation of classes using Class.newInstance();\nhowever, this only works if the class has an appropriate constructor. There\nare many times when a class cannot be instantiated this way, such as when\nthe class contains constructors that require arguments, that have side effects,\nand/or that throw exceptions. As a result, it is common to see restrictions\nin libraries stating that classes must require a default constructor.\nObjenesis aims to overcome these restrictions by bypassing the constructor\non object instantiation. Needing to instantiate an object without calling\nthe constructor is a fairly specialized task, however there are certain cases\nwhen this is useful:\n* Serialization, Remoting and Persistence - Objects need to be instantiated\n  and restored to a specific state, without invoking code.\n* Proxies, AOP Libraries and Mock Objects - Classes can be sub-classed without\n  needing to worry about the super() constructor.\n* Container Frameworks - Objects can be dynamically instantiated in\n  non-standard ways.\n",
