            "Description": "\nOpenCSG is a library that does image-based CSG rendering using OpenGL.\n\nCSG is short for Constructive Solid Geometry and denotes an approach to model\ncomplex 3D-shapes using simpler ones. I.e., two shapes can be combined by\ntaking the union of them, by intersecting them, or by subtracting one shape\nof the other. The most basic shapes, which are not result of such a CSG\noperation, are called primitives. Primitives must be solid, i.e., they must\nhave a clearly defined interior and exterior. By construction, a CSG shape is\nalso solid then.\n\nImage-based CSG rendering (also z-buffer CSG rendering) is a term that denotes\nalgorithms for rendering CSG shapes without an explicit calculation of the\ngeometric boundary of a CSG shape. Such algorithms use frame-buffer settings\nof the graphics hardware, e.g., the depth and stencil buffer, to compose CSG\nshapes. OpenCSG implements a variety of those algorithms, namely the\nGoldfeather algorithm and the SCS algorithm, both of them in several variants.\n",
