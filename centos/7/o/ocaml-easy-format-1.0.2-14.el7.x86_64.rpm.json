It is a pretty-printing\nfacility, i.e. it takes as input some code represented as a tree and\nformats this code into the most visually satisfying result, breaking\nand indenting lines of code where appropriate.\n\nInput data must be first modeled and converted into a tree using 3\nkinds of nodes:\n\n    atoms\n    lists\n    labeled nodes\n\nAtoms represent any text that is guaranteed to be printed as-is. Lists\ncan model any sequence of items such as arrays of data or lists of\ndefinitions that are labeled with something like \"int main\", \"let x\n=\" or \"x:\".\n",
