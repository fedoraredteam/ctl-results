React doesn't define any primitive event or\nsignal, this lets the client chooses the concrete timeline.\n\nReact is made of a single, independent, module and distributed under\nthe new BSD license.\n\nGiven an absolute notion of time Rtime helps you to manage a timeline\nand provides time stamp events, delayed events and delayed signals.\n",
