Documentation can be\nfound under /usr/share/doc, e.g. the reference card (tex-ref.pdf) and\nthe FAQ. The AUCTeX manual is available in Emacs info (C-h i d m\nAUCTeX RET). On the AUCTeX home page, we provide manuals in various\nformats.\n\nAUCTeX includes preview-latex support which makes LaTeX a tightly\nintegrated component of your editing workflow by visualizing selected\nsource chunks (such as single formulas or graphics) directly as images\nin the source buffer.\n\nThis package is for GNU Emacs.\n",
