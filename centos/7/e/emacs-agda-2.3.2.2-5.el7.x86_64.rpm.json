            "Description": "\nAgda is a dependently typed functional programming language: it has\ninductive families, which are similar to Haskell's GADTs, but they can\nbe indexed by values and not just types. It also has parameterized\nmodules, mixfix operators, Unicode characters, and an interactive\nEmacs interface (the type checker can assist in the development of your code).\n\nAgda is also a proof assistant: It is an interactive system for writing and\nchecking proofs. Agda is based on intuitionistic type theory,\na foundational system for constructive mathematics developed by\nthe Swedish logician Per Martin-L\u00f6f. It has many similarities with other\nproof assistants based on dependent types, such as Coq, Epigram and NuPRL.\n\nThis is the interactive Emacs mode for Agda.\n",
