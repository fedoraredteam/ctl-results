Silkscreen is best used in places where extremely small graphical\ndisplay type is needed. The primary use is for navigational items (nav bars,\nmenus, etc), but it works well wherever small type is needed. In order to\npreserve the proper spacing and letterforms, Silkscreen should be used at 8pt.\nmultiples (8pt., 16pt., 24pt., etc.) with anti-aliasing turned off.\n\nThis package consists of files used by other Silkscreen packages.\n",
