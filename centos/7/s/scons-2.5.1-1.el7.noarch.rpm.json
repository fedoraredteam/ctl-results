            "Description": "\nSCons is an Open Source software construction tool--that is, a build\ntool; an improved substitute for the classic Make utility; a better way\nto build software. SCons is based on the design which won the Software\nCarpentry build tool design competition in August 2000.\n\nSCons \"configuration files\" are Python scripts, eliminating the need\nto learn a new build tool syntax. SCons maintains a global view of\nall dependencies in a tree, and can scan source (or other) files for\nimplicit dependencies, such as files specified on #include lines. SCons\nuses MD5 signatures to rebuild only when the contents of a file have\nreally changed, not just when the timestamp has been touched. SCons\nsupports side-by-side variant builds, and is easily extended with user-\ndefined Builder and/or Scanner objects.\n",
