            "Description": "\n\nSilkscreen is a four member type family for your Web graphics created by Jason\nKottke. Silkscreen is best used in places where extremely small graphical\ndisplay type is needed. The primary use is for navigational items (nav bars,\nmenus, etc), but it works well wherever small type is needed. In order to\npreserve the proper spacing and letterforms, Silkscreen should be used at 8pt.\nmultiples (8pt., 16pt., 24pt., etc.) with anti-aliasing turned off.\n\nThis font family has a slightly expanded spacing between the letters in\ncomparison to the normal Silkscreen font family.\n",
