It was developed in order to bring the best solutions found in\nthe world of remote execution together and make them better, faster and more\nmalleable. Salt accomplishes this via its ability to handle larger loads of\ninformation, and not just dozens, but hundreds or even thousands of individual\nservers, handle them quickly and through a simple and manageable interface.\n",
