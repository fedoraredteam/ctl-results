            "Description": "\nShell Flags (shFlags) is a library written to greatly simplify the handling of\ncommand-line flags in Bourne based Unix shell scripts (bash, dash, ksh, sh, zsh)\non many Unix OSes (Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, etc.).\n\nMost shell scripts use getopt for flags processing, but the different versions\nof getopt on various OSes make writing portable shell scripts difficult. shFlags\ninstead provides an API that doesn't change across shell and OS versions so the\nscript writer can be confident that the script will work.\n\nshFlags is a port of the google-gflags C++/Python library.\n",
