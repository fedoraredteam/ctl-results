The\nData (RDF) and code (shared library) functionality in SLV2 is strictly\nseparated so it is simple to control where each is used (e.g. it is possible\nto discover/investigate plugins and related data without loading any shared\nlibraries, avoiding the associated risks).\n\nThis package contains the headers and development libraries for SLV2.\n",
