            "Description": "\nSysUsage continuously monitor your systems information and generate\nperiodic graphical reports using rrdtool or JavaScript jqplot library.\nAll reports are shown through a web interface.\n\nSysUsage grabs all system activities using Sar and system commands allowing\nyou to keep tracks of your computer or server activity during its life.\nIt is a great help for performance analysis and resources management. The\nthreshold notification can alarm you when the system capabilities are\nreached by sending SMTP messages or through Nagios reports.\n\nBy default it will monitor all you need to know on your server activity, it\nis written in Perl and should works on all Unix like platforms. It doesn't\nrequire a Database system like MySQL or PostgreSQL but relies on rrdtool. In\naddition you can embedded your own plugins written in any programming language.\n\nSince release 5.0 SysUsage can be run from a centralized place where\ncollected statistics will be stored and where graphics will be rendered.\nUnlike other monitoring tools with lot of administration work, SysUsage is\ndesign to have the least possible things to configure and a high level of admin\nsystem knowledge. Each server can also be self monitored and you just have to\nconnect your browser to the web interface to know its health level.\n\nSysUsage is design with simplicity in mind. providing all relevant statistics\nfrom the servers within an intuitive web interface and without spending too\nmuch time to configure it, if you know Nagios, you know what I mean. You will\nespecially like SysUsage for that.\n",
