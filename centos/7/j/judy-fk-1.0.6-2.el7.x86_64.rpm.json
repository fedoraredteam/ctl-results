            "Description": "\nJudy is a C library that provides a state-of-the-art core technology that\nimplements a sparse dynamic array. Judy arrays are declared simply with a null\npointer. A Judy array consumes memory only when it is populated, yet can grow\nto take advantage of all available memory if desired. Judy's key benefits are\nscalability, high performance, and memory efficiency. A Judy array is\nextensible and can scale up to a very large number of elements, bounded only by\nmachine memory. Since Judy is designed as an unbounded array, the size of a\nJudy array is not pre-allocated but grows and shrinks dynamically with the\narray population. This package adds a modified SL library that accepts fixed\nlength byte arrays.\n",
