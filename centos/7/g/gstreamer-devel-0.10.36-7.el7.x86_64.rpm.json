Applications using this library can do anything\nfrom real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just about anything\nelse media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means that new data\ntypes or processing capabilities can be added simply by installing new\nplugins.\n\nThis package contains the libraries and includes files necessary to develop\napplications and plugins for GStreamer. If you plan to develop applications\nwith GStreamer, consider installing the gstreamer-devel-docs package and the\ndocumentation packages for any plugins you intend to use.\n",
