It started out as part of\nthe ConText feature parity plugin, which was split into individual plugins\nto better suit Geany's ethos of being as light as possible while allowing\nusers to select which features they want to add to the core editor. The idea\nwas taken from a Text Editor for Windows called ConText.\n\nNormally if you had more than one bookmark, you would have to cycle through\nthem until you reached the one you wanted. With this plugin you can go\nstraight to the bookmark that you want with a single key combination.\n",
