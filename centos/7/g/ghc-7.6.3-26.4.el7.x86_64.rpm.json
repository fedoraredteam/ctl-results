Highlights:\n\n- GHC supports the entire Haskell 2010 language plus various extensions.\n- GHC has particularly good support for concurrency and parallelism,\n  including support for Software Transactional Memory (STM).\n- GHC generates fast code, particularly for concurrent programs\n  (check the results on the \"Computer Language Benchmarks Game\").\n- GHC works on several platforms including Windows, Mac, Linux,\n  most varieties of Unix, and several different processor architectures.\n- GHC has extensive optimisation capabilities,\n  including inter-module optimisation.\n- GHC compiles Haskell code either directly to native code or using LLVM\n  as a back-end. GHC can also generate C code as an intermediate target for\n  porting to new platforms. The interactive environment compiles Haskell to\n  bytecode, and supports execution of mixed bytecode/compiled programs.\n- Profiling is supported, both by time/allocation and heap profiling.\n- GHC comes with core libraries, and thousands more are available on Hackage.\n",
