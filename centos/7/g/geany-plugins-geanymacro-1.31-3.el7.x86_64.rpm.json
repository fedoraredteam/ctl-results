            "Description": "\nGeanyMacro is a plugin to provide user defined macros for Geany. It started\nout as part of the ConText feature parity plugin, which was split into\nindividual plugins to better suit Geany's ethos of being as light as\npossible while allowing users to select which features they want to add to\nthe core editor. The idea was taken from a Text Editor for Windows called\nConText.\n\nThis plugin alows you to record and use your own macros. Macros are\nsequences of actions that can then be repeated with a single key\ncombination. So if you had dozens of lines where you wanted to delete the\nlast 2 characters, you could simple start recording, press End, Backspace,\nBackspace, down line and then stop recording. Then simply trigger the macro\nand it would automaticaly edit the line and move to the next. You could then\njust repeatedly trigger the macro to do as many lines as you want.\n",
