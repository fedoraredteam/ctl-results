It was developed within Canonical as part of the juju project, and\nis based on a pure Go port of the well-known libyaml C library to parse and\ngenerate YAML data quickly and reliably.\n\nThe yaml package supports most of YAML 1.1 and 1.2,\nincluding support for anchors, tags, map merging, etc.\nMulti-document unmarshalling is not yet implemented, and base-60 floats\nfrom YAML 1.1 are purposefully not supported since they're a poor design\n and are gone in YAML 1.2.\n\nThis package contains library source intended for\nbuilding other packages which use import path with\ngopkg.in/v2/yaml prefix.\n",
