            "Description": "\nRoboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are\nlargely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open\ncurves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid\nrhythm, Roboto doesn't compromise, allowing letters to be settled into\ntheir natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more\ncommonly found in humanist and serif types.\n\nThis is the Roboto Slab family, which can be used alongside the normal\nRoboto family and the Roboto Condensed family.\n",
