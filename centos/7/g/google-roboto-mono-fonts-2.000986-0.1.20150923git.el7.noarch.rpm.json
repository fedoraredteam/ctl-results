            "Description": "\nRoboto Mono is a monospaced addition to the Roboto type family. Like the other\nmembers of the Roboto family, the fonts are optimized for readability on\nscreens across a wide variety of devices and reading environments. While the\nmonospaced version is related to its variable width cousin, it doesn't hesitate\nto change forms to better fit the constraints of a monospaced environment. For\nexample, narrow glyphs like 'I', 'l' and 'i' have added serifs for more even\ntexture while wider glyphs are adjusted for weight. Curved caps like 'C' and\n'O' take on the straighter sides from Roboto Condensed.\n",
