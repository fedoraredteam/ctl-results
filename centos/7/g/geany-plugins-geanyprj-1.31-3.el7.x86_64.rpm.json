The idea is to be less a \"session manager\" as the built-in\nproject management does: It allows/requires you to manually open and close\nproject and allows you to store project files in different locations from\nproject sources.\n\nGeanyprj takes a different approach:\nIt never saves session information, so that project files can be stored in\nversion control without constant noise from changes of opened files or cursor\nposition. You also will never have to open/close projects manually. If a\n*.geanyprj file is found somewhere up in path it will be opened automatically.\n",
