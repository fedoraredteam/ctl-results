            "Description": "\nThis package provides a couple of different implementations of mutable\nhash tables in the ST monad, as well as a typeclass abstracting their\ncommon operations, and a set of wrappers to use the hash tables in the\nIO monad.\n\nThis package currently contains three hash table implementations:\n\n1. Data.HashTable.ST.Basic contains a basic open-addressing hash table\nusing linear probing as the collision strategy.\n\n2. Data.HashTable.ST.Cuckoo contains an implementation of \"cuckoo hashing\"\nwhich has worst-case O(1) lookups and can reach a high \"load factor\".\n\n3. Data.HashTable.ST.Linear contains a linear hash table, which trades\nsome insert and lookup performance for higher space efficiency and\nmuch shorter delays when expanding the table.\n",
