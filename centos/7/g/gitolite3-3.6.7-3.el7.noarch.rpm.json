It can also restrict who can push to what branch or tag, which\nis very important in a corporate environment. Gitolite can be installed\nwithout requiring root permissions, and with no additional software than git\nitself and perl. It also has several other neat features described below and\nelsewhere in the doc/ directory.\n",
