Pages can contain links to other pages, and are saved\nautomatically. Creating a new page is as easy as linking to a non-existing\npage. Pages are ordered in a hierarchical structure that gives it the look\nand feel of an outliner. This tool is intended to keep track of TODO lists\nor to serve as a personal scratch book.\n",
