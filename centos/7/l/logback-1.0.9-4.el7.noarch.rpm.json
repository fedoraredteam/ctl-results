            "Description": "\nLogback is intended as a successor to the popular log4j project. At present\ntime, logback is divided into three modules, logback-core, logback-classic\nand logback-access.\n\nThe logback-core module lays the groundwork for the other two modules. The\nlogback-classic module can be assimilated to a significantly improved\nversion of log4j. Moreover, logback-classic natively implements the SLF4J\nAPI so that you can readily switch back and forth between logback and other\nlogging frameworks such as log4j or java.util.logging (JUL).\n\nThe logback-access module integrates with Servlet containers, such as\nTomcat and Jetty, to provide HTTP-access log functionality. Note that you\ncould easily build your own module on top of logback-core.\n",
