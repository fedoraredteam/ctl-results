            "Description": "\nThis package contains miscellaneous system administrator command line\ntools for virtual machines.\n\nGuestfish is the Filesystem Interactive SHell, for accessing and\nmodifying virtual machine disk images from the command line and shell\nscripts.\n\nThe guestmount command lets you mount guest filesystems on the host\nusing FUSE and libguestfs.\n\nVirt-alignment-scan scans virtual machines looking for partition\nalignment problems.\n\nVirt-builder is a command line tool for rapidly making disk images\nof popular free operating systems.\n\nVirt-cat is a command line tool to display the contents of a file in a\nvirtual machine.\n\nVirt-copy-in and virt-copy-out are command line tools for uploading\nand downloading files and directories to and from virtual machines.\n\nVirt-customize is a command line tool for customizing virtual machine\ndisk images.\n\nVirt-df is a command line tool to display free space on virtual\nmachine filesystems.  Unlike other tools, it doesn\u2019t just display the\namount of space allocated to a virtual machine, but can look inside\nthe virtual machine to see how much space is really being used.  It is\nlike the df(1) command, but for virtual machines, except that it also\nworks for Windows virtual machines.\n\nVirt-diff shows the differences between virtual machines.\n\nVirt-edit is a command line tool to edit the contents of a file in a\nvirtual machine.\n\nVirt-filesystems is a command line tool to display the filesystems,\npartitions, block devices, LVs, VGs and PVs found in a disk image\nor virtual machine.  It replaces the deprecated programs\nvirt-list-filesystems and virt-list-partitions with a much more\ncapable tool.\n\nVirt-format is a command line tool to erase and make blank disks.\n\nVirt-get-kernel extracts a kernel/initrd from a disk image.\n\nVirt-inspector examines a virtual machine and tries to determine the\nversion of the OS, the kernel version, what drivers are installed,\nwhether the virtual machine is fully virtualized (FV) or\npara-virtualized (PV), what applications are installed and more.\n\nVirt-log is a command line tool to display the log files from a\nvirtual machine.\n\nVirt-ls is a command line tool to list out files in a virtual machine.\n\nVirt-make-fs is a command line tool to build a filesystem out of\na collection of files or a tarball.\n\nVirt-rescue provides a rescue shell for making interactive,\nunstructured fixes to virtual machines.\n\nVirt-resize can resize existing virtual machine disk images.\n\nVirt-sparsify makes virtual machine disk images sparse (thin-provisioned).\n\nVirt-sysprep lets you reset or unconfigure virtual machines in\npreparation for cloning them.\n\nVirt-tail follows (tails) a log file within a guest, like 'tail -f'.\n\nVirt-tar-in and virt-tar-out are archive, backup and upload tools\nfor virtual machines.  These replace the deprecated program virt-tar.\n\nVirt-win-reg lets you look at and modify the Windows Registry of\nWindows virtual machines.\n",
