            "Description": "\nLibvisual is an abstraction library that comes between applications and\naudio visualisation plugins.\n\nOften when it comes to audio visualisation plugins or programs that create\nvisuals they do depend on a player or something else, basically there is no\ngeneral framework that enable application developers to easy access cool\naudio visualisation plugins. Libvisual wants to change this by providing\nan interface towards plugins and applications, through this easy to use\ninterface applications can easily access plugins and since the drawing is\ndone by the application it also enables the developer to draw the visual\nanywhere he wants.\n",
