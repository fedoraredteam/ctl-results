It features\nsupport for computer and literary braille, supports contracted and uncontracted\ntranslation for many, many languages and has support for hyphenation.\nNew languages can easily be added through tables that support a rule- or\ndictionary based approach. Liblouis also supports math braille\n(Nemeth and Marburg).\n\nLiblouis is based on the translation routines in the BRLTTY screenreader for\nLinux. It has, however, gone far beyond these routines.\nThe library is named in honor of Louis Braille.\n",
