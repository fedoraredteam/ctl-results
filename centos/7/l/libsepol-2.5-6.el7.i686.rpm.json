The Security-enhanced Linux\nkernel contains new architectural components originally developed to\nimprove the security of the Flask operating system. These\narchitectural components provide general support for the enforcement\nof many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those\nbased on the concepts of Type Enforcement\u00ae, Role-based Access\nControl, and Multi-level Security.\n\nlibsepol provides an API for the manipulation of SELinux binary policies.\nIt is used by checkpolicy (the policy compiler) and similar tools, as well\nas by programs like load_policy that need to perform specific transformations\non binary policies such as customizing policy boolean settings.\n",
