            "Description": "\neCAP is a software interface that allows a network application, such as an\nHTTP proxy or an ICAP server, to outsource content analysis and adaptation to\na loadable module. For each applicable protocol message being processed, an\neCAP-enabled host application supplies the message details to the adaptation\nmodule and gets back an adapted message, a \"not interested\" response, or a\n\"block this message now!\" instruction. These exchanges often include message\nbodies.\n\nThe adaptation module can also exchange meta-information with the host\napplication to supply additional details such as configuration options, a\nreason behind the decision to ignore a message, or a detected virus name.\n\nIf you are familiar with the ICAP protocol (RFC 3507), then you may think of\neCAP as an \"embedded ICAP\", where network interactions with an ICAP server are\nreplaced with function calls to an adaptation module.\n",
