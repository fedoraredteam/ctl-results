The\nOSGi specifications originally targeted embedded devices and home services\ngateways, but they are ideally suited for any project interested in the\nprinciples of modularity, component-orientation, and/or service-orientation.\nOSGi technology combines aspects of these aforementioned principles to define a\ndynamic service deployment framework that is amenable to remote management.\n",
