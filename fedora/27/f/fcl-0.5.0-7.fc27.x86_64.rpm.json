            "Description": "\nFCL is a library for performing three types of proximity queries on a pair\nof geometric models composed of triangles.\n* Collision detection: detecting whether the two models overlap, and\noptionally, all of the triangles that overlap.\n* Distance computation: computing the minimum distance between a pair\nof models, i.e., the distance between the closest pair of points.\n* Tolerance verification: determining whether two models are closer or\nfarther than a tolerance distance.\n* Continuous collision detection: detecting whether the two moving models\noverlap during the movement, and optionally, the time of contact.\n* Contact information: for collision detection and continuous collision\ndetection, the contact information (including contact normals and contact\npoints) can be returned optionally.\n",
