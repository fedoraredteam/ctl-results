Besides twisted humor, it includes the actual game\neditor, allowing players to create hundreds of new adventures called\nDink Modules or D-Mods for short.\n\nGNU FreeDink is a new and portable version of the game engine, which\nruns the original game as well as its D-Mods, with close\ncompatibility, under multiple platforms.\n\nThis package is a meta-package to install the game, its data and a\nfront-end to manage game options and D-Mods.\n",
