The solution provides\nfeatures for further integration with Linux based clients (SUDO, automount)\nand integration with Active Directory based infrastructures (Trusts).\nThis is a compatibility package to accommodate freeipa-python split into\npython2-ipalib and freeipa-common. Packages still depending on\nfreeipa-python should be fixed to depend on python2-ipaclient or\nfreeipa-common instead.\n",
