            "Description": "\nFlumotion is a LGPL streaming media server written in Python. It is distributed\nand component-based: every step in the streaming process (production,\nconversion, consumption) can be run inside a separate process on separate\nmachines.\n\nFlumotion uses Twisted and GStreamer. Twisted enables the high-level\nfunctionality, distributing components over the network. GStreamer, through the\nPython bindings, enables the high-speed low-level functionality: actual media\nprocessing.\n\nFlumotion uses a central manager process to control the complete network; one\nor more worker processes distributed over machines to run actual streaming\ncomponents; and one or more admin clients connecting to the manager to control\nit.\n",
