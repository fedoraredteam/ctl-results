            "Description": "\nFFTW is a C subroutine library for computing the Discrete Fourier Transform\n(DFT) in one or more dimensions, of both real and complex data, and of\narbitrary input size. We believe that FFTW, which is free software, should\nbecome the FFT library of choice for most applications. Our benchmarks,\nperformed on on a variety of platforms, show that FFTW's performance is\ntypically superior to that of other publicly available FFT software.\n",
