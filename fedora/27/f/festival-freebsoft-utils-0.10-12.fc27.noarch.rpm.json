They\nprovide all that is needed for interaction with Speech Dispatcher.\n\nKey festival-freebsoft-utils features are:\n- Generalized concept of input events. festival-freebsoft-utils allows not only\n  plain text synthesis, but also combining it with sounds. Additionally,\n  mechanism of logical events mapped to other events is provided.\n- Substitution of events for given words.\n- High-level voice selection mechanism and setting of basic prosodic parameters.\n- Spelling mode.\n- Capital letter signalization.\n- Punctuation modes, for explicit reading or not reading punctuation characters.\n- Incremental synthesis of texts and events.\n- Speech Dispatcher support.\n- Rudimentary SSML support.\n- Enhance the Festival extension language with functions commonly used in Lisp.\n- Support for wrapping already defined Festival functions by your own code.\n- Everything is written in the extension language, no patching of the Festival\n  C++ sources is needed.\n",
