It sends a request to your terminal\n(xterm, for example), which responds back automatically.  When that\nresponse is received, ensuring that fwrestart can communicate with the\nterminal, fwrestart then issues a command to restart the firewall.\nIt then tries another request to the terminal, and if that is not\nreceived within 5 seconds, a command is run to clear the firewall and\nan appropriate error is generated.\n",
