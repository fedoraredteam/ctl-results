These rules can\nbe defined by the user. Fail2Ban can read multiple log files such as sshd or\nApache web server ones.\n\nFail2Ban is able to reduce the rate of incorrect authentications attempts\nhowever it cannot eliminate the risk that weak authentication presents.\nConfigure services to use only two factor or public/private authentication\nmechanisms if you really want to protect services.\n\nThis is a meta-package that will install the default configuration.  Other\nsub-packages are available to install support for other actions and\nconfigurations.\n",
