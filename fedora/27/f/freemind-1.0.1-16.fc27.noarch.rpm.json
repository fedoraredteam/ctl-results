The\nrecent development has hopefully turned it into high productivity tool.\nSo you want to write a completely new metaphysics? Why don't you use\nFreeMind? You have a tool at hand that remarkably resembles the tray\nslips of Robert Pirsig, described in his sequel to Zen and the Art of\nMotorcycle Maintenance called Lila. Do you want to refactor your essays\nin a similar way you would refactor software? Or do you want to keep\npersonal knowledge base, which is easy to manage? Why don't you try\nFreeMind? Do you want to prioritize, know where you are, where you've\nbeen and where you are heading, as Stephen Covey would advise you? Have\nyou tried FreeMind to keep track of all the things that are needed for\nthat?\n",
