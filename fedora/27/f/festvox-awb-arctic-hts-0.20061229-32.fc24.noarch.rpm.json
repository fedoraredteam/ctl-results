            "Description": "\nUS English male speaker (\"AWB\") for Festival. AWB is a native Scottish\nEnglish speaker, but the voice uses the US English front end.\n\nThis is a HMM-based Speech Synthesis System (HTS) voice from the Nagoya\nInstitute of Technology, trained using the CMU ARCTIC database. This voice\nis based on 1138 utterances spoken by a Scottish English male speaker. The\nspeaker is very experienced in building synthetic voices and matched\nprompted US English, though his vowels are very different from US English\nvowels. Scottish English speakers will probably find synthesizers based on\nthis voice strange. Unlike the other CMU_ARCTIC databases this was recorded\nin 16 bit 16KHz mono without EGG, on a Dell Laptop in a quiet office. The\ndatabase was automatically labelled using CMU Sphinx using the FestVox\nlabelling scripts. No hand correction has been made.\n",
