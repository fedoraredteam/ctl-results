            "Description": "\nFactory is a C++ class library that implements a recursive\nrepresentation of multivariate polynomial data.  It handles sparse\nmultivariate polynomials over different coefficient domains, such as Z,\nQ and GF(q), as well as algebraic extensions over Q and GF(q) in an\nefficient way.  Factory includes algorithms for computing univariate and\nmultivariate gcds, resultants, chinese remainders, and algorithms to\nfactorize multivariate polynomials and to compute the absolute\nfactorization of multivariate polynomials with integer coefficients.\n",
