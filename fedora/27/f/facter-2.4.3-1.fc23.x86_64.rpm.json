Facter is especially useful for retrieving\nthings like operating system names, hardware characteristics, IP addresses, MAC\naddresses, and SSH keys.\n\nFacter is extensible and allows gathering of node information that may be\ncustom or site specific. It is easy to extend by including your own custom\nfacts. Facter can also be used to create conditional expressions in Puppet that\nkey off the values returned by facts.\n",
