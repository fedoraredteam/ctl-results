            "Description": "\nFlare (Free Libre Action Roleplaying Engine) is a simple game engine built to\nhandle a very specific kind of game: single-player 2D action RPGs. Flare is not\na re-implementation of an existing game or engine. It is a tribute to and\nexploration of the action RPG genre.\n\nRather than building a very abstract, robust game engine, the goal of this\nproject is to build several real games and harvest an engine from the common,\nreusable code. The first game, in progress, is a fantasy dungeon crawl.\n\nFlare uses simple file formats (INI style configuration files) for most of\nthe game data, allowing anyone to easily modify game contents. Open formats are\npreferred (png, ogg). The game code is C++.\n",
