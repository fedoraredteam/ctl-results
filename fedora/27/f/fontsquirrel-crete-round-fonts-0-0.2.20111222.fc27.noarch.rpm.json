            "Description": "\nCrete Round is a warm slab serif providing a hint of softness to texts. It\nstarted as a tailored version of the original Crete fonts -\nwww.type-together.com/Crete - created specially to serve as corporate typeface\nfor the type design competition Letter2 - www.letter2.org. Crete Round is more\nindependent from the original with modified terminals and serifs to create two\nnew fonts that deliver a more contemporary and functional appearance. The tall\nx-height, low contrast and sturdy slabs prove to be surprisingly efficient for\nweb use. This font supports 128 languages and has 416 glyphs.\n",
