It has a small yet powerful built in set of\nextendable GUI Widgets allowing users to create virtually unlimited types of\nwidgets. Fifechan supports rendering in SDL, OpenGL, or Allegro out of the box\nor it can be adapted to use any rendering engine the user requires. Events are\npushed to Fifechan which allows users to use any input library they wish or\nthey could use the built in input handling through either SDL input or\nAllegro input. The primary goal for Fifechan is to keep it extendable,\nlightweight and still be powerful enough to use in all types of games\nout of the box.\n",
