            "Description": "\nIt is 1949 and you play Joe King, pilot for hire with his small private plane\nthe 'Amazon Queen'. The game is a spoof of old timey radio adventure serials,\nand as it begins we find Joe in one of those typical situations. It is 11:58\nand 36 seconds and counting, Joe and his date are tied up in an abandoned\nwarehouse (\"you really know how to show a girl a good time, Joe!\"), and a bomb\nis set to go off at midnight!\n\nOf course they escape, in the nick of time, and immediately set us up for the\nnext 'adventure'. Joe suddenly remembers that he is scheduled to fly the famous\nmovie star, Faye Russell, to a photo shoot in the Amazon jungle the next\nmorning.\n\nThis package contains the CD version, which contains additional / longer\ncutscenes and voice acting, but also is much larger: 37 MB where as the also\navailable floppy version (package flight-of-the-amazon-queen) is only 7 MB.\n",
