            "Description": "\nfugitive.vim may very well be the best Git wrapper of all time. Check out these\nfeatures:\n\nView any blob, tree, commit, or tag in the repository with :Gedit (and :Gsplit,\n:Gvsplit, :Gtabedit, ...). Edit a file in the index and write to it to stage\nthe changes. Use :Gdiff to bring up the staged version of the file side by side\nwith the working tree version and use Vim's diff handling capabilities to stage\na subset of the file's changes.\n\nBring up the output of git-status with :Gstatus. Press `-` to add/reset a\nfile's changes, or `p` to add/reset --patch. And guess what :Gcommit does!\n\n:Gblame brings up an interactive vertical split with git-blame output. Press\nenter on a line to reblame the file as it stood in that commit, or`o` to open\nthat commit in a split.\n\n:Gmove does a git-mv on a file and simultaneously renames the buffer. :Gremove\ndoes a git-rm on a file and simultaneously deletes the buffer.\n\nUse :Ggrep to search the work tree (or any arbitrary commit) with git-grep,\nskipping over that which is not tracked in the repository. :Glog loads all\nprevious revisions of a file into the quickfix list so you can iterate over\nthem and watch the file evolve!\n\n:Gread is a variant of `git checkout -- filename` that operates on the buffer\nrather than the filename.  This means you can use `u` to undo it and you never\nget any warnings about the file changing outside Vim. :Gwrite writes to both\nthe work tree and index versions of a file, making it like git-add when called\nfrom a work tree file and like git-checkout when called from the index or a\nblob in history.\n\nAdd an indicator with the current branch in (surprise!) your statusline.\n\nOh, and of course there's :Git for running any arbitrary command.\n",
