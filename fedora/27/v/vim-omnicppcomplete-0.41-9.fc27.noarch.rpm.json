It\n   also works for a typedef of an anonymous type.\n\nNotes :\n - The script manage cached datas for optimization.\n - Ambiguous namespaces are detected and are not included in the context stack.\n - The parsed code is tokenized so you can run a completion even if the current\n   instruction has bad indentation, spaces, comments or carriage returns\n   between words\n   (even if it is not realistic).\n",
