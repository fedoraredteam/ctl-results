            "Description": "\nA program for Computer Aided Translation (CAT) and localization.\n\nVirtaal includes features that allow a localizer to work effectively including:\nsyntax highlighting, autocomplete and autocorrect.  By showing only\nthe data that is needed through its simple and effective user interface it\nensures that translators can focus on their current translation task.\n\nA rich set of Translation Memory (TM) plugins provide valuable suggestions to\nthe translator from sources such as Open-Tran.eu, the current file, and the\ntranslators own TM server.  Similarly Machine Translation (MT) suggestions can\ncome from Apertium, libtranslate, Google and Moses.\n\nThe terminology plugin system will provide terminology hints from Open-Tran.eu,\nlocal terminology files and remote terminology repositories.\n\nPlaceholders such as variables, abbreviations, URLs, emails and special\npunctutions are highlighted for easy insertion into the translations.\n\nVirtaal is able to edit any of the following formats: XLIFF, Gettext PO and\n.mo, Qt .ts, .qph and .qm, Wordfast TM, TMX, OmegaT glossaries and TBX. The\nTranslate Toolkit converters allow translators to edit: OpenDocument\nFormat (ODF), OpenOffice.org SDF, Java (and Mozilla) .properties, Mozilla\nDTD files, subtitles, and other formats.\n",
