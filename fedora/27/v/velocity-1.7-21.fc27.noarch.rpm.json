            "Description": "\nVelocity is a Java-based template engine. It permits anyone to use the\nsimple yet powerful template language to reference objects defined in\nJava code.\nWhen Velocity is used for web development, Web designers can work in\nparallel with Java programmers to develop web sites according to the\nModel-View-Controller (MVC) model, meaning that web page designers can\nfocus solely on creating a site that looks good, and programmers can\nfocus solely on writing top-notch code. Velocity separates Java code\nfrom the web pages, making the web site more maintainable over the long\nrun and providing a viable alternative to Java Server Pages (JSPs) or\nPHP.\nVelocity's capabilities reach well beyond the realm of web sites; for\nexample, it can generate SQL and PostScript and XML (see Anakia for more\ninformation on XML transformations) from templates. It can be used\neither as a standalone utility for generating source code and reports,\nor as an integrated component of other systems. Velocity also provides\ntemplate services for the Turbine web application framework.\nVelocity+Turbine provides a template service that will allow web\napplications to be developed according to a true MVC model.\n",
