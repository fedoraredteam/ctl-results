            "Description": "\nThis package provides libvolume_key, a library for manipulating storage volume\nencryption keys and storing them separately from volumes.\n\nThe main goal of the software is to allow restoring access to an encrypted\nhard drive if the primary user forgets the passphrase.  The encryption key\nback up can also be useful for extracting data after a hardware or software\nfailure that corrupts the header of the encrypted volume, or to access the\ncompany data after an employee leaves abruptly.\n",
