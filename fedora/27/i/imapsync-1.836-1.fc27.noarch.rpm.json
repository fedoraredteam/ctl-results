It is useful for mailbox migration,\nand reduces the amount of data transferred by only copying messages that\nare not present on both servers. Read, unread, and deleted flags are preserved,\nand the process can be stopped and resumed. The original messages can\noptionally be deleted after a successful transfer.\n",
