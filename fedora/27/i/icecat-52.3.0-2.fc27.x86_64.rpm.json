Based on Adblock Plus.\n\n * AboutIceCat\n   Adds a custom \"about:icecat\" homepage with links to information about the\n   free software and privacy features in IceCat, and check-boxes to enable\n   and disable the ones more prone to break websites.\n\n * HTML5-video-everywhere\n   Uses the native video player to play embedded videos from different sources\n\n * Fingerprinting countermeasures: Fingerprinting is a series of techniques\n   allowing to uniquely identify a browser based on specific characteristics of\n   that particular instance (like what fonts are available in that machine).\n   Unlike cookies the user cannot opt-out of being tracked this way,\n   so the browser has to avoid giving away that kind of hints.\n",
