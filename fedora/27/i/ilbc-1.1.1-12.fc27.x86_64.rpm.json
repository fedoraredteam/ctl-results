The codec is designed for narrow\nband speech and results in a payload bit rate of 13.33 kbit/s with an\nencoding frame length of 30 ms and 15.20 kbps with an encoding length\nof 20 ms. The iLBC codec enables graceful speech quality degradation in\nthe case of lost frames, which occurs in connection with lost or\ndelayed IP packets.\n",
