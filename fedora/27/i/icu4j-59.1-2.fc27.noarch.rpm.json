ICU supports\nthe most current version of the Unicode standard, and provides support for\nsupplementary characters (needed for GB 18030 repertoire support).\n\nJava provides a very strong foundation for global programs, and IBM and the\nICU team played a key role in providing globalization technology into Sun's\nJava. But because of its long release schedule, Java cannot always keep\nup-to-date with evolving standards. The ICU team continues to extend Java's\nUnicode and internationalization support, focusing on improving\nperformance, keeping current with the Unicode standard, and providing\nricher APIs, while remaining as compatible as possible with the original\nJava text and internationalization API design.\n",
