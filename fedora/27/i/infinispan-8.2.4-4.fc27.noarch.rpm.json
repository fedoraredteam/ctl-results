The purpose of\nInfinispan is to expose a data structure that is highly concurrent,\ndesigned ground-up to make the most of modern multi-processor/multi-core\narchitectures while at the same time providing distributed cache\ncapabilities.  At its core Infinispan exposes a Cache interface which\nextends java.util.Map. It is also optionally is backed by a peer-to-peer\nnetwork architecture to distribute state efficiently around a data grid.\n",
