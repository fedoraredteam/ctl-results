In 2013 the Italics\nwere added.\n\nIt is a display face and the download features both old style and\nlining numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete\nset of diacritics, as well as a stylistic alternate inspired by more\ngeometric sans-serif typefaces than its neo-grotesque inspired default\ncharacter set.\n",
