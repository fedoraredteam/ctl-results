Supported operations on sets include\nintersection, union, set difference, emptiness check, convex hull,\n(integer) affine hull, integer projection, computing the lexicographic\nminimum using parametric integer programming, coalescing and parametric\nvertex enumeration.  It also includes an ILP solver based on generalized\nbasis reduction, transitive closures on maps (which may encode infinite\ngraphs), dependence analysis and bounds on piecewise step-polynomials.\n",
