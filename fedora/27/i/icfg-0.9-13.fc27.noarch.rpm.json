These are\ntext based files, that are normally easily edited by hand, but in many\nenvironments hand editing is not desirable (for instance, during kickstart\ninstallations).  Icfg creates a scriptable interface to allow an admin to\nprovision a systems network interfaces during install, without having to fall\nback to using a series of sed and awk commands\n",
