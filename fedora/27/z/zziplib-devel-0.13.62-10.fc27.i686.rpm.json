Applications\ncan bundle files into a single zip archive and access them. The implementation\nis based only on the (free) subset of compression with the zlib algorithm\nwhich is actually used by the zip/unzip tools.\n\nThis package contains files required to build applications that will use the\nzziplib library.\n",
