            "Description": "\nThe Zero Install Injector makes it easy for users to install software\nwithout needing root privileges. It takes the URL of a program and\nruns it (downloading it first if necessary). Any dependencies of the\nprogram are fetched in the same way. The user controls which version\nof the program and its dependencies to use.\n\nZero Install is a decentralized installation system (there is no\ncentral repository; all packages are identified by URLs),\nloosely-coupled (if different programs require different versions of a\nlibrary then both versions are installed in parallel, without\nconflicts), and has an emphasis on security (all package descriptions\nare GPG-signed, and contain cryptographic hashes of the contents of\neach version). Each version of each program is stored in its own\nsub-directory within the Zero Install cache (nothing is installed to\ndirectories outside of the cache, such as /usr/bin) and no code from\nthe package is run during install or uninstall. The system can\nautomatically check for updates when software is run.\n",
