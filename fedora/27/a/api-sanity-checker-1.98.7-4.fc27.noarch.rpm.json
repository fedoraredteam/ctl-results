            "Description": "\nAPI Sanity Checker (ASC) is an automatic generator of basic unit tests for\nshared C/C++ libraries. It is able to generate reasonable (in most, but\nunfortunately not all, cases) input data for parameters and compose simple\n(\"sanity\" or \"shallow\"-quality) test cases for every function in the API through\nthe analysis of declarations in header files. The quality of generated tests\nallows to check absence of critical errors in simple use cases. The tool is able\nto build and execute generated tests and detect crashes (segfaults), aborts, all\nkinds of emitted signals, non-zero program return code and program hanging. It\nmay be considered as a tool for out-of-the-box low-cost sanity checking\n(fuzzing) of the library API or as a test development framework for initial\ngeneration of templates for advanced tests. Also it supports universal format of\ntests, random test generation mode, specialized data types and other useful\nfeatures.\n",
