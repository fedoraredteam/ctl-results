Its medium contrast is\nsufficient to be reader-friendly and deliver an elegant and refined experience.\n\nIts creator considers it as a \u201cmodernized\u201d garaldic typeface.\n\nAccanthis is well suited to book typesetting and refined presentations.\n\nThis package consists of files used by other adf-accanthis-fonts packages.\n",
