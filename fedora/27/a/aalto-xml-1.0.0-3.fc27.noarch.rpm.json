            "Description": "\nThe Aalto XML processor is a StAX XML processor implementation. It\nis not directly related to other existing mature implementations\n(such as Woodstox or Sun Java Streaming XML Parser), although it\ndid come about as a prototype for evaluating implementation strategies\nthat differ from those traditionally used for Java-based parsers.\n\nTwo main goals (above and beyond stock StAX/SAX API implementation) are:\n\n\u00b0 Ultra-high performance parsing by making the Common Case Fast\n  (similar to original RISC manifesto). This may mean limiting\n  functionality, but never compromising correctness. XML 1.0\n  compliance is not sacrificed for speed.\n\n\u00b0 Allowing non-block, asynchronous parsing: it should be possible to\n  \"feed\" more input and incrementally get more XML events out, without\n  forcing the current thread to block on I/O read operation.\n",
