If you are installing Autoconf, you will also\nneed to install the GNU m4 package.\n\nNote that the Autoconf package is not required for the end-user who\nmay be configuring software with an Autoconf-generated script;\nAutoconf is only required for the generation of the scripts, not their\nuse.\n",
