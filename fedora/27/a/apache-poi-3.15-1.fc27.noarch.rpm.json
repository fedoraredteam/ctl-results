            "Description": "\nThe Apache POI Project's mission is to create and maintain Java APIs for\nmanipulating various file formats based upon the Office Open XML standards\n(OOXML) and Microsoft's OLE 2 Compound Document format (OLE2). In short, you\ncan read and write MS Excel files using Java. In addition, you can read and\nwrite MS Word and MS PowerPoint files using Java. Apache POI is your Java\nExcel solution (for Excel 97-2008). We have a complete API for porting other\nOOXML and OLE2 formats and welcome others to participate.\n\nOLE2 files include most Microsoft Office files such as XLS, DOC, and PPT as\nwell as MFC serialization API based file formats. The project provides APIs\nfor the OLE2 Filesystem (POIFS) and OLE2 Document Properties (HPSF).\n\nOffice OpenXML Format is the new standards based XML file format found in\nMicrosoft Office 2007 and 2008. This includes XLSX, DOCX and PPTX. The\nproject provides a low level API to support the Open Packaging Conventions\nusing openxml4j.\n\nFor each MS Office application there exists a component module that attempts\nto provide a common high level Java API to both OLE2 and OOXML document\nformats. This is most developed for Excel workbooks (SS=HSSF+XSSF). Work is\nprogressing for Word documents (HWPF+XWPF) and PowerPoint presentations\n(HSLF+XSLF).\n\nThe project has recently added support for Outlook (HSMF). Microsoft opened\nthe specifications to this format in October 2007. We would welcome\ncontributions.\n\nThere are also projects for Visio (HDGF) and Publisher (HPBF).\n",
