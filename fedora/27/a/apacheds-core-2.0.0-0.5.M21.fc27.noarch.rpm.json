            "Description": "\nServer's core contains the JNDI provider, interceptors,\nschema, and database subsystems. The core is the heart\nof the server without protocols enabled.\n- A linked in memory AVL tree implementation with Cursor.\n- Contains classes that store interfaces with various\nconstants in ApacheDS.\nCursor interfaces used by the server core.\nServer side LDAP entry classes.\nIntegration testing framework for Apache Directory Server.\nContains a JNDI provider implementation which wraps the\ncore so existing applications based on JNDI can use the\nserver embedded transparently. Remote and local run-time\noperations will appear and feel exactly the same with a\nperformance boost when local. All operations via this\nJNDI provider bypass the LDAP stack to perform operations\ndirectly on the ApacheDS core.\nA collection of tools as plugins to manage various tasks\nassociated with the directory server.\nShared classes between the core plugin and the core to\nprevent cyclic dependencies since the core uses the core\nplugin.\nA linked in memory splay tree implementation with Cursor.\nCore unit tests.\n",
