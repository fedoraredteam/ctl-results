            "Description": "\nSometimes it is useful if we can capture the state of the application,\nits stack of function calls, which includes local variables, the global\nvariables and the program counter, and save them into an object. If\nthis object would give us the ability to restart the processing from\nthe point stored in it.\nA continuation is exactly the type of object that we need. Think of a\ncontinuation as an object that, for a given point in your program,\ncontains a snapshot of the stack trace, including all the local\nvariables, and the program counter. You can not only store these\nthings in the continuation object, but also restore the execution\nof the program from a continuation object. This means that the stack\ntrace and the program counter of the running program become the ones\nstored in a continuation.\nContinuations are powerful concepts from the world of functional\nlanguages, like Scheme, but they are becoming popular in other\nlanguages as well.\n",
