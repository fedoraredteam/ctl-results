            "Description": "\n\nA Latin typeface published by Hirwen Harendal's Arkandis Digital Foundry,\nAccanthis was inspired from the \u201cCloister Oldstyle\u201d typeface found in the\n\u201cAmerican Specimen Book of Typefaces Suplement\u201d. Its medium contrast is\nsufficient to be reader-friendly and deliver an elegant and refined experience.\n\nIts creator considers it as a \u201cmodernized\u201d garaldic typeface.\n\nAccanthis is well suited to book typesetting and refined presentations.\n\nThis variant is closer to the \u201cHorley old style\u201d typeface than the original\nversion.\n",
