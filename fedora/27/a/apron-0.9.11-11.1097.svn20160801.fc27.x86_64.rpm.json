The aim of such an\nanalysis is to infer invariants about these variables, like 1<=x+y<=z,\nwhich holds during any execution of the program.\n\nThe APRON library is intended to be a common interface to various\nunderlying libraries/abstract domains and to provide additional services\nthat can be implemented independently from the underlying\nlibrary/abstract domain.\n",
