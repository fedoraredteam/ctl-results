            "Description": "\nHirwen Harendal started in 1999 the realization of a first font family, aiming\nto create another \u201cTimes New Roman\u201d\u2026 He does not consider this endeavour a huge\nsuccess. However, he transformed Tribun progessively since then to give it its\nown character.\n\nThe idea was to achieve newsprint-like rendering. To this effect, the glyph\nbodies, serifs, or even extenders are not normalised and use irregular strokes.\nThis is most visible in italics though those variations stay imperceptible at\nsmall sizes.\n\nItalics proved time-consuming. They are never an easy thing to draw.\nNevertheless, the designer considers them very close to those of \u201cTimes\u201d, with\nsome variations.\n\nThe medium weight uses a stronger stroke. It can be used for emphasis, or for\neffects in titles. That being said it has also been used for body copy. It is\nalso slightly expanded to complete the face offerings.\n\nThe condensed version is a bit unusual, since it stands in for both normal and\nmedium condensed. After several trials, Hirwen decided an intermediate weight\nrendered much better both for document display and in print. Secondly, he took\ngreat care to keep readability excellent, and this even for italics.\n\nThis font family is particularly well suited for text, display, or\npresentations. It is also ideal for all Web publications. It can serve as\nalternative to \u201cTimes New Roman\u201d and other similar fonts.\n",
