This work is repetitive and becomes even\nmore complicated when different sets of validation rules need to be applied to\nthe same set of data based on locale for example. Error messages may also vary\nby locale. This package attempts to address some of these issues and speed\ndevelopment and maintenance of validation rules.\n",
