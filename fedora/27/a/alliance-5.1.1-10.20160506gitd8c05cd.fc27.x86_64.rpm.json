It includes a vhdl compiler and simulator, logic synthesis tools,\nand automatic place and route tools. A complete set of portable cmos libraries\nis provided. Alliance is the result of a twelve year effort spent at SoC\ndepartment of LIP6 laboratory of the Pierre & Marie Curie University (Paris\nVI, France). Alliance has been used for research projects such as the 875 000\ntransistors StaCS superscalar microprocessor and 400 000 transistors ieee\nGigabit HSL Router.\n\nAlliance provides CAD tools covering most of all the digital design flow:\n\n * VHDL Compilation and Simulation\n * Model checking and formal proof\n * RTL and Logic synthesis\n * Data-Path compilation\n * Macro-cells generation\n * Place and route\n * Layout edition\n * Netlist extraction and verification\n * Design rules checking\n\nAlliance is listed among Fedora Electronic Lab (FEL) packages.\n",
