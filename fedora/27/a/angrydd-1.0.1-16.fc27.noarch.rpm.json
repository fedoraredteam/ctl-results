But you've decided to take your aggression out on other\ndwarves, by dropping gems on their heads. Lots of gems. ADD is a member of the\nclassic \"falling blocks\" puzzle game family, similar to the Capcom game Puzzle\nFighter. The goal of the game is to build large gems by matching up colors,\nthen break them, raining more gems down onto your opponent. The first person\nwhose field fills up, loses.\n",
