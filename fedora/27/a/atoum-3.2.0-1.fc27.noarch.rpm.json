            "Description": "\nA simple, modern and intuitive unit testing framework for PHP!\n\nIt has been designed from the start with the following ideas in mind :\n* Can be implemented rapidly ;\n* Simplify test development ;\n* Allow for writing reliable, readable, and clear unit tests ;\n\nTo accomplish that, it massively uses capabilities provided by PHP 5.3,\nto give the developer a whole new way of writing unit tests.\nAlso, thanks to its fluid interface, it allows for writing unit tests in\na fashion close to natural language.\nIt also makes it easier to implement stubbing within tests, thanks to\nintelligent uses of anonymous functions and closures.\natoum natively, and by default, performs the execution of each unit test\nwithin a separate PHP process, to warrant isolation.\nOf course, it can be used seamlessly for continuous integration, and given its\ndesign, it can be made to cope with specific needs extremely easily.\natoum also accomplishes all of this without affecting performance, since it\nhas been developed to boast a reduced memory footprint while allowing for\nhastened test execution.\nIt can also generate unit test execution reports in the Xunit format,\nwhich makes it compatible with continuous integration tools such as Jenkins.\natoum also generates code coverage reports, in order to make it possible\nto supervise unit tests.\n\nOptional dependency:\n- php-pecl-xdebug for code coverage reports\n",
