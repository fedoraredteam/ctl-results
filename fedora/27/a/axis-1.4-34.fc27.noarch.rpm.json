It is an XML based protocol that consists of three\nparts: an envelope that defines a framework for describing what is in a message\nand how to process it, a set of encoding rules for expressing instances of\napplication-defined datatypes, and a convention for representing remote\nprocedure calls and responses.\n\nThis project is a follow-on to the Apache SOAP project.\n",
