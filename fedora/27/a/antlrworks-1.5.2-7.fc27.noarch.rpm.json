            "Description": "\nANTLRWorks is a novel grammar development environment for ANTLR v3 grammars\nwritten by Jean Bovet (with suggested use cases from Terence Parr). It combines\nan excellent grammar-aware editor with an interpreter for rapid prototyping and\na language-agnostic debugger for isolating grammar errors. ANTLRWorks helps\neliminate grammar nondeterminisms, one of the most difficult problems for\nbeginners and experts alike, by highlighting nondeterministic paths in the\nsyntax diagram associated with a grammar. ANTLRWorks' goal is to make grammars\nmore accessible to the average programmer, improve maintainability and\nreadability of grammars by providing excellent grammar navigation and\nrefactoring tools, and address the most common questions and problems\nencountered by grammar developers.\n",
