            "Description": "\nCommons-launcher eliminates the need for a batch or shell script to launch a\nJava class. Some situations where elimination of a batch or shell script may\nbe desirable are:\n\n* You want to avoid having to determining where certain application paths are\ne.g. your application's home directory, etc. Determining this dynamically in\na Windows batch scripts is very tricky on some versions of Windows or when\nsoft links are used on Unix platforms.\n\n* You want to avoid having to handle native file and path separators or native\npath quoting issues.\n\n* You need to enforce certain system properties.\n\n* You want to allow users to pass in custom JVM arguments or system properties\nwithout having to parse and reorder arguments in your script. This can be\ntricky and/or messy in batch and shell scripts.\n\n* You want to bootstrap system properties from a configuration file instead\nhard-coding them in your batch and shell scripts.\n\n* You want to provide localized error messages which is very tricky to do in\nbatch and shell scripts.\n",
