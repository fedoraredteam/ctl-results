The Commons Lang Component provides\nthese extra methods.\nThe Commons Lang Component provides a host of helper utilities for the\njava.lang API, notably String manipulation methods, basic numerical\nmethods, object reflection, creation and serialization, and System\nproperties. Additionally it contains an inheritable enum type, an\nexception structure that supports multiple types of nested-Exceptions\nand a series of utilities dedicated to help with building methods, such\nas hashCode, toString and equals.\n\nWith version of commons-lang 3.x, developers decided to change API and\ntherefore created differently named artifact and jar files. This is\nthe new version, while apache-commons-lang is the compatibility\npackage.\n",
