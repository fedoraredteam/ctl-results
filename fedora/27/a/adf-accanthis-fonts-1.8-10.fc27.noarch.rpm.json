Its medium contrast is\nsufficient to be reader-friendly and deliver an elegant and refined experience.\n\nIts creator considers it as a \u201cmodernized\u201d garaldic typeface.\n\nAccanthis is well suited to book typesetting and refined presentations.\n\nIt is intended to serve as alternative to the \u201cGalliard\u201d typeface.\n",
