For each\nsuch target it then will:\n\n   1. Execute the target named setUp, if there is one.\n   2. Execute the target itself - if this target depends on other targets the\n      normal Ant rules apply and the dependent targets are executed first.\n   3. Execute the target names tearDown, if there is one.\n",
