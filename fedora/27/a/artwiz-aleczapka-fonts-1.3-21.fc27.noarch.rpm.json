The minimal nature of the\nfonts makes them popular with users of lightweight window managers. These\nfonts have been updated by Alec Zapka to be compatible with modern\nsoftware and support an extended character set.\nThis is a metapackage, which pulls in all the separated fonts in this family.\n",
