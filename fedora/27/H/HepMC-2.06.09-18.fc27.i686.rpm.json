            "Description": "\nThe HepMC package is an object oriented event record written in C++\nfor High Energy Physics Monte Carlo Generators. Many extensions from\nHEPEVT, the Fortran HEP standard, are supported: the number of entries\nis unlimited, spin density matrices can be stored with each vertex,\nflow patterns (such as color) can be stored and traced, integers\nrepresenting random number generator states can be stored, and an\narbitrary number of event weights can be included. Particles and\nvertices are kept separate in a graph structure, physically similar to\na physics event. The added information supports the modularization of\nevent generators. The package has been kept as simple as possible with\nminimal internal/external dependencies. Event information is accessed\nby means of iterators supplied with the package.\n",
