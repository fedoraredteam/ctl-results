            "Description": "\nHERMES is a library designed to convert a source buffer with a specified pixel\nformat to a destination buffer with possibly a different format at the maximum\npossible speed.\n\nOn x86 and MMX architectures, handwritten assembler routines are taking over\nthe job and doing it lightning fast.\n\nOn top of that, HERMES provides fast surface clearing, stretching and some\ndithering. Supported platforms are basically all that have an ANSI C compiler\nas there is no platform specific code but those are supported: DOS, Win32\n(Visual C), Linux, FreeBSD (IRIX, Solaris are on hold at the moment), some BeOS\nsupport.\n",
