It is inspired by the libnotify API.\n\nDesktop Notifications provide a standard way of doing passive pop-up\nnotifications on the Linux desktop. These are designed to notify the\nuser of something without interrupting their work with a dialog box\nthat they must close. Passive pop-ups can automatically disappear after\na short period of time.\n",
