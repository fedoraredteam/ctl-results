            "Description": "\nNaga aims to be a very small NIO library that provides a handful of\njava classes to wrap the usual Socket and ServerSocket with\nasynchronous NIO counterparts (similar to NIO2 planned for Java 1.7).\n\nAll of this is driven from a single thread, making it useful for both\nclient (e.g. allowing I/O to be done in the AWT-thread without any\nneed for threads) and server programming (1 thread for all connections\ninstead of 2 threads/connection).\n\nInternally Naga is a straightforward NIO implementation without any\nthreads or event-queues thrown in, it is \"just the NIO-stuff\", to let\nyou build things on top of it.\n\nNaga contains the code needed to get NIO up and running without having\nto code partially read buffers and setting various selection key\nflags.\n",
