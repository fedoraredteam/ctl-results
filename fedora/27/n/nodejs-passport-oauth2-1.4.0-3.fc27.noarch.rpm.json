            "Description": "\nGeneral-purpose OAuth 2.0 authentication strategy for Passport.\n\nThis module lets you authenticate using OAuth 2.0 in your Node.js\napplications. By plugging into Passport, OAuth 2.0 authentication can\nbe easily and unobtrusively integrated into any application or\nframework that supports Connect-style middleware, including Express.\n\nNote that this strategy provides generic OAuth 2.0 support. In many\ncases, a provider-specific strategy can be used instead, which cuts\ndown on unnecessary configuration, and accommodates any\nprovider-specific quirks. See the list for supported providers.\n\nDevelopers who need to implement authentication against an OAuth 2.0\nprovider that is not already supported are encouraged to sub-class\nthis strategy. If you choose to open source the new provider-specific\nstrategy, please add it to the list so other people can find it.\n",
