It\nprovides a mapping from objects to values, but allows any entry to be\ngarbage collected if the key is provably lost.\n\nIn order for it to be possible that a key is provably lost, weak maps\ndo not provide a way to access the key list.\n\nThis is a Node.js module that provides a shim and patcher for missing\nor broken WeakMap implementations, suitable for use in Node.js and\nbrowsers that provide the EcmaScript 5 property description interfaces.\n",
