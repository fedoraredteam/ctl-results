Or just switch user ids to interact with the system e.g.\na user space file server. To be able to test that you need the privilege to\nmodify the passwd and groups file. With nss_wrapper it is possible to define\nyour own passwd and groups file which will be used by software to act correctly\nwhile under test.\n\nIf you have a client and server under test they normally use functions to\nresolve network names to addresses (dns) or vice versa. The nss_wrappers allow\nyou to create a hosts file to setup name resolution for the addresses you use\nwith socket_wrapper.\n\nTo use it set the following environment variables:\n\nLD_PRELOAD=libuid_wrapper.so\nNSS_WRAPPER_PASSWD=/path/to/passwd\nNSS_WRAPPER_GROUP=/path/to/group\nNSS_WRAPPER_HOSTS=/path/to/host\n\nThis package doesn't have a devel package cause this project is for\ndevelopment/testing.\n",
