It uses a Space-based approach that makes it easier to write\ndistributed applications. NWS looks and feels like a conventional workspace\nin the base scripting language, enables network script processes to share\ndata, provides general distributed/parallel script execution, runs network\nscript processes either uncoupled or coordinated, and dramatically increases\ndeveloper productivity in implementing and maintaining distributed\napplications because of its anonymous communication.\n",
