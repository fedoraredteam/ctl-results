            "Description": "\nA fast and robust stringmap implementation that can hold any string keys,\nincluding __proto__, with minimal overhead compared to a plain object. Works in\nnode and browsers.\n\nThe API is created to be as close to the ES6 Map API as possible. Prefer\nsm.remove(\"key\") for deleting a key. ES6 Map uses map.delete(\"key\") instead and\nfor that reason sm['delete'](\"key\") is available as a stringmap alias as well.\nNever do sm.delete(\"key\") unless you're certain to be in the land of ES5 or\nlater.\n",
