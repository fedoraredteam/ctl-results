It will\nlearn your event emitting patterns and find ways to exterminate\nthem. Allowing you to remove only the event emitters that you\nassigned and not the ones that your users or developers assigned.\nThis can prevent race conditions, memory leaks and even file\ndescriptor leaks from ever happening as you won't remove clean\nup processes.\n",
