A promise is an object that represents the\nreturn value or the thrown exception that the function may eventually provide.\nA promise can also be used as a proxy for a remote object to overcome latency.\n\nQ can exchange promises with jQuery, Dojo, When.js, WinJS, and more.\nAdditionally, there are many libraries that produce and consume Q promises for\neverything from file system/database access or RPC to templating.\n",
