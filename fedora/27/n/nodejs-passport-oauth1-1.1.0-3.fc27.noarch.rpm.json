By plugging into Passport, OAuth authentication can be\neasily and unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework\nthat supports Connect-style middleware, including Express.\n\nNote that this strategy provides generic OAuth support. In many cases,\na provider-specific strategy can be used instead, which cuts down on\nunnecessary configuration, and accommodates any provider-specific\nquirks. See the list for supported providers.\n\nDevelopers who need to implement authentication against an OAuth\nprovider that is not already supported are encouraged to sub-class\nthis strategy. If you choose to open source the new provider-specific\nstrategy, please add it to the list so other people can find it.\n",
