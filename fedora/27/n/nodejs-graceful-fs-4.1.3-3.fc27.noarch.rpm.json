Otherwise it becomes a noop.\n* Ignores EINVAL and EPERM errors in chown, fchown or lchown if the\n  user isn't root.\n* Makes lchmod and lchown become noops, if not available.\n* Retries reading a file if read results in EAGAIN error.\n\nOn Windows, it retries renaming a file for up to one second if EACCESS\nor EPERM error occurs, likely because antivirus software has locked the\ndirectory.\n",
