            "Description": "\nA fast and robust stringset implementation that can hold any string items,\nincluding __proto__, with minimal overhead compared to a plain object. Works in\nnode and browsers.\n\nThe API is created to be as close to the ES6 Set API as possible. Prefer\nss.remove(\"key\") for deleting a key. ES6 Set uses set.delete(\"key\") instead and\nfor that reason ss['delete'](\"key\") is available as a stringset alias as well.\nNever do ss.delete(\"key\") unless you're certain to be in the land of ES5 or\nlater.\n",
