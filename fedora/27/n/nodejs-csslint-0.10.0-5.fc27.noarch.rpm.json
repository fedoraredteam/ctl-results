It does\nbasic syntax checking as well as applying a set of rules to the code that\nlook for problematic patterns or signs of inefficiency. The rules are all\npluggable, so you can easily write your own or omit ones you don't want.\n\nYou can find information about both using CSS Lint and contributing to the\nproject in the wiki: https://github.com/stubbornella/csslint/wiki\n",
