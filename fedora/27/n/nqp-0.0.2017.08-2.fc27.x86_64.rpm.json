The key feature of NQP is that it's designed to be a very small\nenvironment (as compared with, say, perl6 or Rakudo) and is focused on being\na high-level way to create compilers and libraries for virtual machines (such\nas JVM and MoarVM). Unlike a full-fledged implementation of Perl 6, NQP\nstrives to have as small a run-time footprint as it can, while still providing\na Perl 6 object model and regular expression engine for the virtual machine.\n",
