            "Description": "\nNfSpy is a Python library for automating the falsification of NFS credentials\nwhen mounting an NFS share. Included are two client programs:\n\n- nfspy uses the Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) library to mount an NFS share\n  in Linux. This allows the use of any regular file-searching and manipulation\n  programs like grep and find to explore the NFS export.\n- nfspysh is a ftp-like interactive shell for exploring NFS exports. It does\n  not require the FUSE library, so it can run on non-Linux platforms.\n",
