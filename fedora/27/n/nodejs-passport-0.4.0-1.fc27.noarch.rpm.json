            "Description": "\nPassport is an authentication framework for Connect and Express, which\nis extensible through \"plugins\" known as strategies.\n\nPassport is designed to be a general-purpose, yet simple, modular, and\nunobtrusive, authentication framework. Passport's sole purpose is to\nauthenticate requests. In being modular, it doesn't force any particular\nauthentication strategy on your application. In being unobtrusive, it\ndoesn't mount routes in your application. The API is simple: you give\nPassport a request to authenticate, and Passport provides hooks for\ncontrolling what occurs when authentication succeeds or fails.\n",
