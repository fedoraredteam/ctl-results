            "Description": "\nNX is a software suite which implements very efficient compression of\nthe X11 protocol. This increases performance when using X\napplications over a network, especially a slow one.\n\nnxagent is an agent providing NX transport of X sessions. The\napplication is based on the well-known Xnest server. nxagent, like\nXnest, is an X server for its own clients, and at the same time, an X\nclient for a system's local X server.\n\nThe main scope of nxagent is to eliminate X round-trips or transform\nthem into asynchronous replies. nxagent works together with nxproxy.\nnxproxy itself does not make any effort to minimize round-trips by\nitself, this is demanded of nxagent.\n\nBeing an X server, nxagent is able to resolve all the property/atoms\nrelated requests locally, ensuring that the most common source of\nround-trips are nearly reduced to zero.\n",
