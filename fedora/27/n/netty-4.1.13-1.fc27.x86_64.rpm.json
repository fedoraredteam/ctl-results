It greatly simplifies and streamlines network programming\nsuch as TCP and UDP socket server.\n\n'Quick and easy' doesn't mean that a resulting application will suffer\nfrom a maintainability or a performance issue. Netty has been designed\ncarefully with the experiences earned from the implementation of a lot\nof protocols such as FTP, SMTP, HTTP, and various binary and\ntext-based legacy protocols. As a result, Netty has succeeded to find\na way to achieve ease of development, performance, stability, and\nflexibility without a compromise.\n",
