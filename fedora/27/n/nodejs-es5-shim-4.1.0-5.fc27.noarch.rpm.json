For these methods, as closely as possible to ES5 is not very close.\nMany of these shams are intended only to allow code to be written to ES5\nwithout causing run-time errors in older engines. In many cases, this means\nthat these shams cause many ES5 methods to silently fail. Decide carefully\nwhether this is what you want. Note: es5-sham.js requires es5-shim.js to be\nable to work properly.\n",
