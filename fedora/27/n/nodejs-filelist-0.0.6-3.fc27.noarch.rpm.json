When given a list of\nglob patterns for possible files to be included in the file list,\ninstead of searching the file structures to find the files, a FileList\nholds the pattern for latter use.\n\nThis allows you to define a FileList to match any number of files, but\nonly search out the actual files when then FileList itself is actually\nused. The key is that the first time an element of the FileList/Array\nis requested, the pending patterns are resolved into a real list of\nfile names.\n",
