            "Description": "\nNorduGrid is a collaboration aiming at development, maintenance and\nsupport of the free Grid middleware, known as the Advanced Resource\nConnector (ARC).\n\nThe Advanced Resource Connector (ARC) brings computing resources\ntogether across institutional boundaries. This concept is commonly\nreferred to as a \"computational grid\". Historically, grids address the\norganization of distributed storage of data and parallel computation,\nbut could be expanded to arbitrary services.\n\nJust like the web, ARC has its roots in the IT infrastructure that was\nerected to analyze the experiments for high energy physics at CERN.\nThe first release, ARC-0.x, was dependent on Globus, the current\nrelease keeps that compatibility but can also be used independently.\n",
