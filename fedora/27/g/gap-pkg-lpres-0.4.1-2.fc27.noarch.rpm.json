            "Description": "\nThe lpres package provides a first construction of finitely L-presented\ngroups and a nilpotent quotient algorithm for L-presented groups.  The\nfeatures of this package include:\n- creating an L-presented group as a new gap object,\n- computing nilpotent quotients of L-presented groups and epimorphisms\n  from the L-presented group onto its nilpotent quotients,\n- computing the abelian invariants of an L-presented group,\n- computing finite-index subgroups and if possible their L-presentation,\n- approximating the Schur multiplier of L-presented groups.\n",
