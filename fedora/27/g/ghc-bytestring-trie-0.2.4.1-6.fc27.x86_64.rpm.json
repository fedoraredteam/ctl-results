            "Description": "\nAn efficient finite map from bytestrings to values.\n\nThe implementation is based on big-endian patricia trees, like \"Data.IntMap\".\nWe first trie on the elements of \"Data.ByteString\" and then trie on the\nbig-endian bit representation of those elements. Patricia trees have efficient\nalgorithms for union and other merging operations, but they're also quick for\nlookups and insertions.\n\nIf you are only interested in being able to associate strings to values, then\nyou may prefer the 'hashmap' package which is faster for those only needing a\nmap-like structure. This package is intended for those who need the extra\ncapabilities that a trie-like structure can offer (e.g., structure sharing to\nreduce memory costs for highly redundant keys, taking the submap of all keys\nwith a given prefix, contextual mapping, extracting the minimum and maximum\nkeys, etc.).\n",
