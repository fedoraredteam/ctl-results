With HistoryManager Prefix Search, you can type the beginning\nof a command, and then hit the PageUp and PageDown keys to cycle through\nprevious commands which match the prefix you typed.\n\n**NOTE:** After installing, each user that wants WindowOverlay Icons\nmust still enable the extension before it will take effect. You can do\nso a few different ways:\n\n* If you've already installed the GNOME Shell integration web browser\n  plugin, go to <https://extensions.gnome.org/local/>, find the\n  extension, and click the switch to \"ON.\"\n* Open GNOME Tweak Tool, go to the Extensions tab, find the extension,\n  and click the switch to \"ON.\"\n* Open a terminal or the desktop's command dialog and run:\n  gnome-shell-extension-tool --enable historymanager-prefix-search@sustmidown.centrum.cz\n\nYou may also need to restart GNOME Shell (open the command dialog with\nAlt-F2, type `r`, and hit enter), or log out and log back in.\n",
