            "Description": "\nThis typeface is a product of Deckersche Schriftgie\u00dfere typefoundry owned by\nRudolf Ludwig Decker (1804-1877) in Berlin, but it was frequently used in\nGreek editions by both Oxford and Cambridge University Press during the last\ndecades of the 19th century. It was designed and cut before 1864, according to\nJohn Bowman, when a set of matrices was bought by OUP, although the type was\nnot cast and used in England until 1882.\n\n\nThe typeface is an uncial design containing a case of capitals, and small\ncapitals, too. The letters lack any sherifs although they retain their thick\nand thin strokes. It appeared as an alternate type of Byzantine tradition in\nmostly patristic texts.\n\n\nThe font was digitally designed by George D. Matthiopoulos and is freely\navailable by GFS.\n",
