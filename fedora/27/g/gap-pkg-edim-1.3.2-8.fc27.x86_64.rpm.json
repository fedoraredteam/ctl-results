            "Description": "\nThe main purpose of the EDIM package is to publish an implementation of\nan algorithm (found by the package author) for computing prime parts of\nthe elementary divisors of integer matrices (i.e., the diagonal entries\nof the Smith normal form).\n\nThe programs are developed and already successfully used for large\nmatrices (up to rank >12000) with moderate entries and many non-trivial\nelementary divisors which are products of some small primes. But they\nshould be useful for other types of matrices as well.\n\nAmong the other functions of the package are:\n- an inversion algorithm for large rational matrices (using a p-adic\n  method)\n- a program for finding the largest elementary divisor of an integral\n  matrix (particularly interesting when this is much smaller than the\n  determinant) and\n- implementations of some normal form algorithms described by Havas,\n  Majewski, Matthews, Sterling (using LLL- or modular techniques).\n",
