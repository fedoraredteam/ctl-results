            "Description": "\nA text typeface using the Greek letters designed by Alexander Wilson\n(1714-1786), a Scottish doctor, astronomer, and type founder, who established a\ntype foundry in Glasgow in 1744. The type was especially designed for an\nedition of Homer\u2019s epics, published in 1756-8 by Andrew and Robert Foulis,\nprinters to the University of Glasgow. A modern revival, Wilson Greek, was\ndesigned by Matthew Carter in 1995. Peter S. Baker is also using Wilson\u2019s Greek\ntype in his Junicode font for medieval scholars (2007).\n\nLatin and Cyrillic are based on a Garamond typeface. The font covers the\nWindows Glyph List, IPA Extensions, Greek Extended, Ancient Greek Numbers,\nByzantine and Ancient Greek Musical Notation, various typographic extras and\nseveral Open Type features (Case-Sensitive Forms, Small Capitals, Subscript,\nSuperscript, Numerators, Denominators, Fractions, Old Style Figures, Historical\nForms, Stylistic Alternates, Ligatures).\n\nIt was created by George Douros.\n",
