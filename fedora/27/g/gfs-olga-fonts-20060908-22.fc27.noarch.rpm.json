            "Description": "\nIn Greece the terms italic and oblique have the same meaning since they are\nborrowed from the latin typographic practice without any real historical\nequivalent in Greek history. Until the end of the 19th century Greek typefaces\nwere cut and cast indepedently, not as members of a typefamily. The\nmechanisation of typecutting allowed the transformation of upright Greek\ntypefaces to oblique designs. Nonetheless, the typesetting practice of a\ncursive Greek font to complement an upright one did not survive the 19th\ncentury.\n\nThe experimental font GFS Olga (1995) attempts to revive this lost tradition.\nThe typeface was designed and digitised by George Matthiopoulos, based on the\nhistorical Porson Greek type (1803) with the intention to be the companion of\nthe upright GFS Didot font whenever there is a need for an italic alternative.\n",
