            "Description": "\nPut simply, Guice alleviates the need for factories and the use of new\nin your Java code. Think of Guice's @Inject as the new new. You will\nstill need to write factories in some cases, but your code will not\ndepend directly on them. Your code will be easier to change, unit test\nand reuse in other contexts.\n\nGuice embraces Java's type safe nature, especially when it comes to\nfeatures introduced in Java 5 such as generics and annotations. You\nmight think of Guice as filling in missing features for core\nJava. Ideally, the language itself would provide most of the same\nfeatures, but until such a language comes along, we have Guice.\n\nGuice helps you design better APIs, and the Guice API itself sets a\ngood example. Guice is not a kitchen sink. We justify each feature\nwith at least three use cases. When in doubt, we leave it out. We\nbuild general functionality which enables you to extend Guice rather\nthan adding every feature to the core framework.\n",
