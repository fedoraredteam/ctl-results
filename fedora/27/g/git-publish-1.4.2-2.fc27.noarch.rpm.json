            "Description": "\ngit-publish handles repetitive and time-consuming details of managing patch\nemail submission.  It works with individual patches as well as patch series and\nhas support for pull request emails.\n\nEach revision is stored as a git tag including the cover letter (if any).  This\nmakes it easy to refer back to previous revisions of a patch.  Numbering is\nhandled automatically and the To:/Cc: email addresses are remembered across\nrevisions to save you retyping them.\n\nMany projects have conventions for submitting patches.  It is possible to\nencode them as a .gitpublish file and hooks/ scripts.  This automatically uses\nthe right settings and can run a coding style checker or linting tools before\nemails are sent.\n",
