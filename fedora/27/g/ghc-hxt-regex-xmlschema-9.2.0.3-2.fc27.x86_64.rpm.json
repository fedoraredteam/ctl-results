The complete grammar can be found under\n<http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#regexs>. It is implemented by the\ntechnique of derivations of regular expressions.\n\nThe W3C syntax is extended to support not only union of regular sets, but also\nintersection, set difference, exor. Matching of subexpressions is also\nsupported.\n\nThe library can be used for constricting lightweight scanners and tokenizers.\nIt is a standalone library, no external regex libraries are used.\n\nExtensions in 9.2: The library does nor only support String's, but also\nByteString's and Text in strict and lazy variants.\n",
