            "Description": "\nThis plugins consists of various small addons too small to justify their own\nplugin, but are useful to have. The following functionality is implemented:\n* Document list: This addon places a new item in the toolbar and when clicked\n  offers a menu listing all open files plus the 'Close All' and 'Close Other\n  Documents' menu items. This can be useful to quickly access open files and\n  switch to them.\n* Open and Copy URI: Adds 'Open URI' and 'Copy URI' menu items to the editor\n  menu when the word under the cursor looks like a URI. 'Open URI' uses the\n  browser command configured in Geany to open it.\n* Tasks: The tasks plugin goes through a file being edited and picks out\n  lines with configurable keywords (e.g. \"TODO\" or \"FIXME\") in them. It\n  collects the text after those words and puts them in a new \"Tasks\" tab in\n  the message window. Clicking on a task in that tab takes you to the line in\n  the file where the task was defined.\n* Systray: Adds a status icon to the notification area (systray) and provides\n  a simple popup menu with some basic actions. It can also be used to\n  quickly show and hide the Geany main window.\n* Bookmark list: Add a list of defined bookmarks (line markers) to the sidebar.\n  This list contains all bookmarks defined in the current file\n  for faster overview and access.\n* Mark Word: When double-clicking a word, all occurrences of this word are\n  searched and then highlighted (similar to Geany's 'Mark All' Find option).\n* Strip trailing blank lines: This addon removes excessive trailing blank\n  lines from the document when it is saved. If you have 'Ensure new line at\n  file end' option checked in Preferences, one trailing newline will be left.\n* XML tagging: XML tagging allows to easy tag a selected text, by checking for a\n  selection, offering a little dialog for inserting a tag and\n  replacing a selection.\n",
