            "Description": "\nA library for generating high quality random numbers that follow\neither a uniform or normal distribution.  The generated numbers are\nsuitable for use in statistical applications.\n\nThe uniform PRNG uses Marsaglia's MWC256 (also known as MWC8222)\nmultiply-with-carry generator, which has a period of 2^8222 and fares well in\ntests of randomness. It is also extremely fast, between 2 and 3 times faster\nthan the Mersenne Twister.\n\nCompared to the mersenne-random package, this package has a more\nconvenient API, is faster, and supports more statistical distributions.\n",
