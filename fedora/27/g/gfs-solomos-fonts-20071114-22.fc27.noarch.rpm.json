            "Description": "\nFrom the middle of the 19th century an italic font with many calligraphic\novertones was introduced into Greek printing. Its source is unknown, but it\nalmost certainly was the product of a German or Italian foundry. In the first\ntype specimen printed in Greece by the typecutter K. Miliadis (1850), the font\nwas listed anonymously along others of 11pts and in the Gr. Doumas' undated\nspecimen appeared as \u00ab11pt Greek inclined\u00bb. For most of the second half of the\ncentury the type was used extensively as an italic for emphasis in words,\nsentences or exerpts. In 1889, the folio size Type Specimen of Anestis\nKonstantinidis' publishing, printing and type founding establishment also\nincluded the type as \u00abGreek inclined [9 & 12 pt]\u00bb.\n\nNevertheless, the excessively calligraphic style of the characters, combined\nwith the steep and uncomfortable obliqueness of the capitals, was out of\nfavour in the 20th century and the type did not survive the conformity of the\nmechanical type cutting and casting.\n\nThe font has been digitally revived, as part of our typographic tradition, by\nGeorge D. Matthiopoulos and is part of GFS' type library under the name GFS\nSolomos, in commemoration of the great Greek poet of the 19th century,\nDionisios Solomos.\n",
