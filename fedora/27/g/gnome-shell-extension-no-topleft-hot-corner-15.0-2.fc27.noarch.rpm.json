            "Description": "\nThe top-left hot corner in GNOME Shell makes it easier to toggle the Activities\nOverview --- perhaps a little too easy. No Topleft Hot Corner simply disables\nthe hot corner, so you don't have to worry about accidentally triggering\nActivities anymore when moving the mouse near the top-left of the screen. But\nyou can still toggle the overview by clicking on the Activities button.\n\n**NOTE:** After installing, each user that wants it must still manually enable\nNo Topleft Hot Corner before it will take effect. You can do so a few different\nways:\n\n* If you've already installed the GNOME Shell integration web browser plugin,\n  go to <https://extensions.gnome.org/local/>, find the extension, and click\n  the switch to \"ON.\"\n* Open GNOME Tweak Tool, go to the Extensions tab, find the extension, and click\n  the switch to \"ON.\"\n* Open a terminal or the desktop's command dialog, and (as your normal user\n  account) run `gnome-shell-extension-tool --enable nohotcorner@azuri.free.fr`\n\nYou may also need to restart GNOME Shell (Open the command dialog with Alt-F2,\ntype `r`, and hit enter), or log out and log back in.\n",
