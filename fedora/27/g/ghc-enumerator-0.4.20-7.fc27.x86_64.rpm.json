            "Description": "\nEnumerators are an efficient, predictable, and safe alternative to lazy I/O.\nDiscovered by Oleg Kiselyov, they allow large datasets to be processed\nin near-constant space by pure code. Although somewhat more complex to write,\nusing enumerators instead of lazy I/O produces more correct programs.\n\nThis library contains an enumerator implementation for Haskell, designed to\nbe both simple and efficient. Three core types are defined, along with\nnumerous helper functions:\n\n* /Iteratee/: Data sinks, analogous to left folds. Iteratees consume\na sequence of /input/ values, and generate a single /output/ value.\nMany iteratees are designed to perform side effects (such as printing to\nstdout), so they can also be used as monad transformers.\n\n* /Enumerator/: Data sources, which generate input sequences. Typical\nenumerators read from a file handle, socket, random number generator, or\nother external stream. To operate, enumerators are passed an iteratee, and\nprovide that iteratee with input until either the iteratee has completed its\ncomputation, or EOF.\n\n* /Enumeratee/: Data transformers, which operate as both enumerators and\niteratees. Enumeratees read from an /outer/ enumerator, and provide the\ntransformed data to an /inner/ iteratee.\n",
