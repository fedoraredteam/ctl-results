            "Description": "\nJohn Baskerville (1706-1775) got involed in typography late in his career but\nhis contribution was significant. He was a successful entrepreneur and\npossesed an inquiring mind which he applied to produce many aesthetic and\ntechnical innovations in printing. He invented a new ink formula, a new type\nof smooth paper and made various improvements in the printing press. He was\nalso involved in type design which resulted in a latin typeface which was used\nfor the edition of Virgil, in 1757. The quality of the type was admired\nthroughout of Europe and America and was revived with great success in the\nearly 20th century.\n\nBaskerville was also involved in the design of a Greek typeface which he used\nin an edition of the New Testament for Oxford University, in 1763. He adopted\nthe practice of avoiding the excessive number of ligatures which Alexander\nWilson had started a few years earlier but his Greek types were rather narrow\nin proportion and did not win the sympathy of the philologists and other\nscholars of his time. They did influence, however, the Greek types of\nGiambattista Bodoni. and through him Didot's Greek in Paris.\n\nThe typeface has been digitally revived as GFS Baskerville Classic by Sophia\nKalaitzidou and George D. Matthiopoulos and is now available as part of GFS'\ntype library.\n",
