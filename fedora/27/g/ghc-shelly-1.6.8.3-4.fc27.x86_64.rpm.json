Shelly:\n\n* is aimed at convenience and getting things done rather than being\n  a demonstration of elegance.\n* has detailed and useful error messages\n* maintains its own environment, making it thread-safe.\n* is modern, using Text and system-filepath/system-fileio\n\nShelly is originally forked from the Shellish library.\n\nAn overview is available in the README:\n<https://github.com/yesodweb/Shelly.hs/blob/master/README.md>.\n",
