            "Description": "\nEven though Geany supports symbol definition searching by itself within the\nopen files (and with a plugin support within the whole project), tag\nregeneration can become too slow for really big projects. This is why this\nplugin was created. It makes it possible to generate the tag file only once and\njust query it when searching for a particular symbol definition/declaration.\nThis approach is fine for big projects where most of the codebase remains\nunchanged and the tag positions remain more or less static.\n",
