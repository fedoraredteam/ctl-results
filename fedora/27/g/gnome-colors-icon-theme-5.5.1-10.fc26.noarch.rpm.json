There are already seven full color-schemes\navailable; Brave (Blue), Human (Orange), Wine (Red), Noble (Purple), Wise\n(Green), Dust (Chocolate) and Illustrious (Pink). An unlimited amount of\ncolor variations can be rebuilt and recolored from source, so users need\nnot stick to the officially supported color palettes.\n\nGNOME-Colors is mostly inspired/based on Tango, GNOME, Elementary,\nTango-Generator and many other open-source projects. More information\ncan be found in the AUTHORS file.\n",
