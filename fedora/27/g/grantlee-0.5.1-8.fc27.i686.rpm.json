The goals of the project are to make it easier for\napplication developers to separate the structure of documents from the\ndata they contain, opening the door for theming.\n\nThe syntax is intended to follow the syntax of the Django template system,\nand the design of Django is reused in Grantlee.\nDjango is covered by a BSD style license.\n\nPart of the design of both is that application developers can extend\nthe syntax by implementing their own tags and filters. For details of\nhow to do that, see the API documentation.\n\nFor template authors, different applications using Grantlee will present\nthe same interface and core syntax for creating new themes. For details of\nhow to write templates, see the documentation.\n",
