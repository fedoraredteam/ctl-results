            "Description": "\nActivities Configurator gives you all sorts of options to control the look and\nfeel of the top bar and Activities button in GNOME Shell, possibly even\noverriding your current Shell theme. You can change or remove the Activities\nbutton text, add an icon, move it to right corner, change the top bar's\nbackground color and transparency... You can toggle the Overview if no\napplications are running (at login and whenever the last application window is\nclosed). You can also adjust the \"pressure\" threshold for the hot corner, or\ndisable it altogether.\n\n**NOTE:** After installing, each user that wants it must still manually enable\nActivities Configurator before it will take effect. You can do so a few\ndifferent ways:\n\n* If you've already installed the GNOME Shell integration web browser plugin,\n  go to <https://extensions.gnome.org/local/>, find the extension, and click\n  the switch to \"ON.\"\n* Open GNOME Tweak Tool, go to the Extensions tab, find the extension, and click\n  the switch to \"ON.\"\n* Open a terminal or the desktop's command dialog, and (as your normal user\n  account) run `gnome-shell-extension-tool --enable activities-config@nls1729`\n\nYou may also need to restart GNOME Shell (Open the command dialog with Alt-F2,\ntype `r`, and hit enter), or log out and log back in.\n",
