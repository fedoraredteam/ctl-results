            "Description": "\nGriechische Antiqua was one of the historical Greek typefaces of the late 19th\nand early 20th century. It was designed by \u039caurice \u0395duard Pinder, a German\nerudite artist and a member of the Academy of Science in Berlin. This is the\nmost popular version which has appeared from 1870 to 1940 in the German\nspeaking philological literature and in many classical and Byzantine editions\nby publishers like Teubner (in Leipzig) and Weidmann (in Berlin) such as:\nAnthology of Byzantine Melos by Wilhelm von Christ and Matthaios\nParanikas (Leipzig 1871), Epicurea, by Heinrich Usener (Leipzig 1887),\nMitrodorous by Alfred Koerte (Leipzig 1890), Pindar by Otto Schroeder (Leipzig\n1908), \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 Aeschylus by U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff (Berlin 1910, 1915),\nBachylides by Bruno Snell (Leipzig, 1934),  The Vulgata by Alfred Rahlfs\n(Stuttgart 1935), Suidas Lexicon by Ada Adler (Leipzig 1928-1938) etc.\n\nE.J.
