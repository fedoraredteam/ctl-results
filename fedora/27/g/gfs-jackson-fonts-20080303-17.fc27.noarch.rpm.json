            "Description": "\nAs it is known, the Greek alphabet was used in majuscule form for over a\nmillennium before the minuscule letters gradually replaced it until they became\nthe official script in the 9th century A.D. Thereafter, majuscule letters were\nconfined to sparse use as initials or elaborate titles until the Italian\nRenaissance.\n\nThe new art of Typography, as well as the need of the humanists to mimic the\nancient Greco-Roman period brought back the extensive use of the majuscule\nletter-forms in both Latin and Greek typography. Greek books of the time were\nprinted using the contemporary Byzantine hand with which they combined capital\nletters modelled on the Roman antiquity, i.e. with thick and thin strokes and\nserifs. At the same time the Byzantine majuscule tradition, principally used on\ntheological editions, remainned alive until the early 19th century.\n\nGFS Jackson is an edition of the font cut, in 1788, by Joseph Jackson on\ncommission by the Cambridge University in preparation of the edition of the\nBeza codex containning the New Testament from the 5th-6th century. Theodore\nBeza was the erudite scholar from Geneva who had given the codex as a gift to\nthe University in 1581.\n\nIt has been designed by George D. Matthiopoulos.\n",
