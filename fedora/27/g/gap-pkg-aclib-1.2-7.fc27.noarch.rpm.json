            "Description": "\nThe AClib package contains a library of almost crystallographic groups\nand some algorithms to compute with these groups.  A group is called\nalmost crystallographic if it is finitely generated nilpotent-by-finite\nand has no nontrivial finite normal subgroups.  Further, an almost\ncrystallographic group is called almost Bieberbach if it is\ntorsion-free.  The almost crystallographic groups of Hirsch length 3 and\na part of the almost cyrstallographic groups of Hirsch length 4 have\nbeen classified by Dekimpe.  This classification includes all almost\nBieberbach groups of Hirsch lengths 3 or 4.  The AClib package gives\naccess to this classification; that is, the package contains this\nlibrary of groups in a computationally useful form.  The groups in this\nlibrary are available in two different representations.  First, each of\nthe groups of Hirsch length 3 or 4 has a rational matrix representation\nof dimension 4 or 5, respectively, and such representations are\navailable in this package.  Secondly, all the groups in this library\nare (infinite) polycyclic groups and the package also incorporates\npolycyclic presentations for them.  The polycyclic presentations can be\nused to compute with the given groups using the methods of the\nPolycyclic package.\n",
