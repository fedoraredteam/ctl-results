            "Description": "\nHAP is a homological algebra library for use with the GAP computer\nalgebra system, and is still under development.  Its initial focus is on\ncomputations related to the cohomology of groups.  Both finite and\ninfinite groups are handled, with emphasis on integral coefficients.\n\nRecent additions include some functions for computing homology of\ncrossed modules and simplicial groups, and also some functions for\nhandling simplicial complexes, cubical complexes and regular\nCW-complexes in the context of topological data analysis.\n",
