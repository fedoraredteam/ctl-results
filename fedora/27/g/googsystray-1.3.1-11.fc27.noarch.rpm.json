The idea is to be able to keep track of all\nthat stuff without having to keep a bunch of browser tabs open, or constantly\nchecking them. It notifies on new messages, alerts, etc., and provides basic\nservices quickly (Reading or sending a new SMS message, or marking an email\nread, for example.)\n",
