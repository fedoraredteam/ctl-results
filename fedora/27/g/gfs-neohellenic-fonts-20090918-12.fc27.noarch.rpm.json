            "Description": "\nThe design of new Greek typefaces always followed the growing needs of the\nClassical Studies in the major European Universities. Furthermore, by the end\nof the 19th century bibliology had become an established section of Historical\nStudies, and, as John Bowman commented, the prevailing attitude was that Greek\ntypes should adhere to a lost idealized, yet undefined, greekness of yore.\nEspecially in Great Britain this tendency remained unchallenged in the first\ndecades of the 20th century, both by Richard Proctor, curator of the incunabula\nsection in the British Museum Library and his successor Victor Scholderer.\n\nIn 1927, Scholderer, on behalf of the Society for the Promotion of Greek\nStudies, got involved in choosing and consulting the design and production of a\nGreek type called New Hellenic cut by the Lanston Monotype Corporation. He\nchose the revival of a round, and almost monoline type which had first appeared\nin 1492 in the edition of Macrobius, ascribable to the printing shop of\nGiovanni Rosso (Joannes Rubeus) in Venice. New Hellenic was the only successful\ntypeface in Great Britain after the introduction of Porson Greek well over a\ncentury before. The type, since to 1930\u2019s, was also well received in Greece,\nalbeit with a different design for Ksi and Omega.\n\nGFS digitized the typeface (1993-1994) funded by the Athens Archeological\nSociety with the addition of a new set of epigraphical symbols. Later (2000)\nmore weights were added (italic, bold and bold italic) as well as a latin\nversion.\n",
