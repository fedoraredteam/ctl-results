            "Description": "\nThe GNU diff algorithm translated to a Java class. The Diff class computes\nthe differences between two Object arrays as a list of changes.  This is\nvery general purpose.  Any of the options to GNU diff can be efficiently\nimplemented as variations on how Object.equals() is implemented and how the\nchange list is printed.  DiffPrint now sports a setOutput() method.  The\nDiffPrint.Base class and derivatives should really be renamed out of the\nempty package.\n",
