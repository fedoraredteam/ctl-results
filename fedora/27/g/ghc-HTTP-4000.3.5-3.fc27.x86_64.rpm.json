            "Description": "\nThe HTTP package supports client-side web programming in Haskell. It lets you\nset up HTTP connections, transmitting requests and processing the responses\ncoming back, all from within the comforts of Haskell. It's dependent on the\nnetwork package to operate, but other than that, the implementation is all\nwritten in Haskell.\n\nA basic API for issuing single HTTP requests + receiving responses is provided.\nOn top of that, a session-level abstraction is also on offer (the\n'BrowserAction' monad); it taking care of handling the management of persistent\nconnections, proxies, state (cookies) and authentication credentials required\nto handle multi-step interactions with a web server.\n\nThe representation of the bytes flowing across is extensible via the use of a\ntype class, letting you pick the representation of requests and responses that\nbest fits your use. Some pre-packaged, common instances are provided for\n'ByteString' and 'String'.\n",
