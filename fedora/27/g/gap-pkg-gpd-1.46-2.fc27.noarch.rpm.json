            "Description": "\nThe Gpd package provides functions for computation with finite groupoids\nand their morphisms.\n\nThe first part is concerned with the standard constructions for\nconnected groupoids, and for groupoids with more than one component.\nGroupoid morphisms are also implemented, and recent work includes the\nimplementation of automorphisms of a finite, connected groupoid: by\npermutation of the objects; by automorphism of the root group; and by\nchoice of rays to each object.  The automorphism group of such a\ngroupoid is also computed, together with an isomorphism of a quotient of\npermutation groups.\n\nThe second part implements graphs of groups and graphs of groupoids.  A\ngraph of groups is a directed graph with a group at each vertex and with\nisomorphisms between subgroups on each arc.  This construction enables\nnormal form computations for free products with amalgamation, and for\nHNN extensions, when the vertex groups come with their own rewriting\nsystems.\n",
