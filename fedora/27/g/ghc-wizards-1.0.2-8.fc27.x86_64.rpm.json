            "Description": "\n'wizards' is a package designed for the quick and painless development of\n/interrogative/ programs, which revolve around a \"dialogue\" with the user, who\nis asked a series of questions in a sequence much like an installation wizard.\n\nEverything from interactive system scripts, to installation wizards, to\nfull-blown shells can be implemented with the support of 'wizards'.\n\nIt is developed transparently on top of a free monad, which separates out the\nsemantics of the program from any particular interface. A variety of backends\nexist, including console-based \"System.Console.Wizard.Haskeline\" and\n\"System.Console.Wizard.BasicIO\", and the pure \"System.Console.Wizard.Pure\".\nIt is also possible to write your own backends, or extend existing back-ends\nwith new features. While both built-in IO backends operate on a console, there\nis no reason why 'wizards' cannot also be used for making GUI wizard\ninterfaces.\n\n\n\nSee the github page for examples on usage:\n\n<http://www.github.com/liamoc/wizards>\n\nFor creating backends, the module \"System.Console.Wizard.Internal\" has a brief\ntutorial.\n",
