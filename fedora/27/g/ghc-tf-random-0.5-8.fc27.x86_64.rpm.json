            "Description": "\nThis package contains an implementation of a high-quality splittable\npseudorandom number generator. The generator is based on a cryptographic hash\nfunction built on top of the ThreeFish block cipher. See the paper /Splittable\nPseudorandom Number Generators Using Cryptographic Hashing/ by Claessen, Pa\u0142ka\nfor details and the rationale of the design.\n\nThe package provides the following:\n\n* A splittable PRNG that implements the standard 'System.Random.RandomGen'\nclass.\n\n* The generator also implements an alternative version of the\n'System.Random.TF.Gen.RandomGen' class (exported from \"System.Random.TF.Gen\"),\nwhich requires the generator to return pseudorandom integers from the full\n32-bit range, and contains an n-way split function.\n\n* An alternative version of the 'Random' class is provided, which is linked to\nthe new 'RandomGen' class, together with 'Random' instances for some integral\ntypes.\n\n* Two functions for initialising the generator with a non-deterministic seed:\none using the system time, and one using the '/dev/urandom' UNIX special file.\n\nThe package uses an adapted version of the reference C implementation of\nThreeFish from the reference package of the Skein hash function\n(<https://www.schneier.com/skein.html>), originally written by Doug Whiting.\n\nPlease note that even though the generator provides very high-quality\npseudorandom numbers, it has not been designed with cryptographic applications\nin mind.\n",
