            "Description": "\nFreon is a GNOME Shell extension for displaying the temperature of your CPU,\nhard disk, solid state, and video card (NVIDIA, Catalyst, and Bumblebee\nsupported), as well as power supply voltage, and fan speed. You can choose which\nHDD/SSD or other devices to include, what temperature units to use, and how\noften to refresh the sensors readout, and they will appear in the GNOME Shell\ntop bar. For the GPU temperature, you may need to install the vendor's driver\nfor best results.\n\n**NOTE:** Freon relies on lm_sensors. You must run `sensors-detect` before Freon\nwill be able to detect and display hardware temperatures. The default options\nfor sensors-detect are safe for most systems; however, there is a small, but\nnon-zero chance of causing hardware damage or a kernel panic. See the discussion\non GitHub -- https://github.com/groeck/lm-sensors/issues/17\n\n**NOTE:** After installing, each user that wants it must still manually enable\nFreon before it will take effect. You can do so a few different ways:\n\n* If you've already installed the GNOME Shell integration web browser plugin,\n  go to <https://extensions.gnome.org/local/>, find the extension, and click\n  the switch to \"ON.\"\n* Open GNOME Tweak Tool, go to the Extensions tab, find the extension, and click\n  the switch to \"ON.\"\n* Open a terminal or the desktop's command dialog, and (as your normal user\n  account) run:\n  gnome-shell-extension-tool --enable freon@UshakovVasilii_Github.yahoo.com\n\nYou may also need to restart GNOME Shell (Open the command dialog with Alt-F2,\ntype `r`, and hit enter), or log out and log back in.\n",
