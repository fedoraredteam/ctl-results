Datatypes are viewed\nin a uniform, structured way: the choice between constructors is represented\nusing an n-ary sum, and the arguments of each constructor are represented using\nan n-ary product.\n\nThe module \"Generics.SOP\" is the main module of this library and contains more\ndetailed documentation.\n\nExamples of using this library are provided by the following packages:\n\n* '<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/basic-sop basic-sop>' basic examples,\n\n* '<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pretty-sop pretty-sop>' generic pretty\nprinting,\n\n* '<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-sop lens-sop>' generically\ncomputed lenses,\n\n* '<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/json-sop json-sop>' generic JSON\nconversions.\n\nA detailed description of the ideas behind this library is provided by the\npaper:\n\n* Edsko de Vries and Andres L\u00f6h.\n<http://www.andres-loeh.de/TrueSumsOfProducts True Sums of Products>.\nWorkshop on Generic Programming (WGP) 2014. .\n",
