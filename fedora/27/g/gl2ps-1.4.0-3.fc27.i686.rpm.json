            "Description": "\nGL2PS is a C library providing high quality vector output for any\nOpenGL application. The main difference between GL2PS and other\nsimilar libraries is the use of sorting algorithms capable of handling\nintersecting and stretched polygons, as well as non manifold objects.\nGL2PS provides advanced smooth shading and text rendering, culling of\ninvisible primitives, mixed vector/bitmap output, and much more...\n\nGL2PS can currently create PostScript (PS), Encapsulated PostScript\n(EPS) and Portable Document Format (PDF) files, as well as LaTeX files\nfor the text fragments. Adding new vector output formats should be\nrelatively easy (and amongst the formats we would be interested in\nadding, SVG is first in line). Meanwhile, you can use the excellent\npstoedit program to transform the PostScript files generated by GL2PS\ninto many other vector formats such as xfig, cgm, wmf, etc.\n",
