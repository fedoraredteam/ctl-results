Highlights:\n\n- GHC supports the entire Haskell 2010 language plus a wide variety of\n  extensions.\n- GHC has particularly good support for concurrency and parallelism,\n  including support for Software Transactional Memory (STM).\n- GHC generates fast code, particularly for concurrent programs.\n  Take a look at GHC's performance on The Computer Language Benchmarks Game.\n- GHC works on several platforms including Windows, Mac, Linux,\n  most varieties of Unix, and several different processor architectures.\n- GHC has extensive optimisation capabilities, including inter-module\n  optimisation.\n- GHC compiles Haskell code either directly to native code or using LLVM\n  as a back-end. GHC can also generate C code as an intermediate target for\n  porting to new platforms. The interactive environment compiles Haskell to\n  bytecode, and supports execution of mixed bytecode/compiled programs.\n- Profiling is supported, both by time/allocation and various kinds of heap\n  profiling.\n- GHC comes with several libraries, and thousands more are available on Hackage.\n",
