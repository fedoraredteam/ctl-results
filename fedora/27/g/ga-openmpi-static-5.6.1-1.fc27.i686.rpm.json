            "Description": "\n\nThe Global Arrays (GA) toolkit provides an efficient and portable\n\"shared-memory\" programming interface for distributed-memory\ncomputers. Each process in a MIMD parallel program can asynchronously\naccess logical blocks of physically distributed dense multi-\ndimensional arrays, without need for explicit cooperation by other\nprocesses. Unlike other shared-memory environments, the GA model\nexposes to the programmer the non-uniform memory access (NUMA)\ncharacteristics of the high performance computers and acknowledges\nthat access to a remote portion of the shared data is slower than to\nthe local portion. The locality information for the shared data is\navailable, and a direct access to the local portions of shared data\nis provided.\n- Static Libraries against OpenMPI.\n",
