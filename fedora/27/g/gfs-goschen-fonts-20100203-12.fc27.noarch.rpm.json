            "Description": "\nGeorg Joachim G\u00f6schen founded in 1782 the publishing house of G.J.\nG\u00f6schensche Verlagsbuchhandlung in Leipzig and was one of the most active\npublishers of the period in Germany. G\u00f6schen was very interested in\ntypography, influenced by the fame and quality of the editions of G. Bodoni\nand F. Didot.\n\nIn 1797, he collaborated with the leading scholar of the period, Johann Jakob\nGriesbach, to edit and publish the New Testament in Greek for which he formed\na committee of scholars to decide the new Greek type which were eventually\ncut by Johann Prillwitz. The book appeared in 1803 and the types show many\ninfluences from the Greek types of Bodoni. Their characteristic was the\nneoclassical form of marked contrast between thick and thin strokes, the\ncursive style and the large size of the font.\n\nThe design was too cumbersome to allow general use and can be considered\nsuccessful only for its indirect influence on the later cut Greek Leipzig\ntype. It is, however, part of the greater heritage of Greek type design and\ntherefore the type has been digitized by George D. Matthiopoulos in 2009 and\nis part of GFS' type library under the name GFS G\u00f6schen cursive, in\ncommemoration of the great German publisher.\n",
