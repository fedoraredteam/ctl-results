            "Description": "\nThe purpose of this library is to \"guess\" the encoding of files, and retrieve\na reader that is properly configured to use the right encoding as guessed.\nThe library is able to recognize the various Unicode encoding variants:\n\n    * UTF-8\n    * UTF-16LE - Low Endian\n    * UTF-16BE - Big Endian\n    * UTF-32\n\nIf a Unicode encoding isn't recognized, it's an 8-bit encoding. If the 8-bit\nencoding is not US-ASCII, the default platform 8-bit encoding is assumed\nwhatever it is. However, the library cannot guess between different 8-bit\nencodings. Only statistical analysis, n-grams and similar techniques specific\nto each language used in those files can help guessing the encoding, but this\nis not supported by the library.\n",
