            "Description": "\nUnder the influence of the neoclassical ideals of the late 18th century, the\nfamous French typecutter Firmin Didot in Paris designed a new Greek typeface\n(1805) which was immediately used in the publishing programme of Adamantios\nKorai, the prominent intellectual figure of the Greek diaspora and leading\nscholar of the Greek Enlightenment. The typeface eventually arrived in Greece,\nwith the field press which came with Didot\u2019s grandson Ambroise Firmin Didot,\nduring the Greek Revolution in 1821. Since then the typeface has enjoyed an\nunrivaled success as the type of choice for almost every kind of publication\nuntil the last decades of the 20th century.\n\nDidot's original type design, as it is documented in publications during the\nfirst decades of the 19th century, was digitized and revived by George D.\nMatthiopoulos in 2006 for a project of the Department of Literature in the\nSchool of Philosophy at the University of Thessaloniki, and is now available\nfor general use.\n",
