Gradle can automate the building,\ntesting, publishing, deployment and more of software packages or other\ntypes of projects such as generated static websites, generated\ndocumentation or indeed anything else.\n\nGradle combines the power and flexibility of Ant with the dependency\nmanagement and conventions of Maven into a more effective way to\nbuild. Powered by a Groovy DSL and packed with innovation, Gradle\nprovides a declarative way to describe all kinds of builds through\nsensible defaults. Gradle is quickly becoming the build system of\nchoice for many open source projects, leading edge enterprises and\nlegacy automation challenges.\n",
