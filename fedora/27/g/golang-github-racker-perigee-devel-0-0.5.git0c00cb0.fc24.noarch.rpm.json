Perigee grew out of the need to refactor out\ncommon API access code from the gorax project.\n\nSeveral things influenced the name of the project. Numerous elements\nof the OpenStack ecosystem are named after astronomical artifacts.\nAdditionally, perigee occurs when two orbiting bodies are closest\nto each other. Perigee seemed appropriate for something aiming to bring\nOpenStack and other RESTful services closer to the end-user.\n\nThis library is still in the very early stages of development.\n\nThis package contains library source intended for\nbuilding other packages which use import path with\ngithub.com/racker/perigee prefix.\n",
