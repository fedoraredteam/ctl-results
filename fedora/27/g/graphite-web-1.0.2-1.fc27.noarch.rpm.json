            "Description": "\nGraphite consists of a storage backend and a web-based visualization frontend.\nClient applications send streams of numeric time-series data to the Graphite\nbackend (called carbon), where it gets stored in fixed-size database files\nsimilar in design to RRD. The web frontend provides user interfaces\nfor visualizing this data in graphs as well as a simple URL-based API for\ndirect graph generation.\n\nGraphite's design is focused on providing simple interfaces (both to users and\napplications), real-time visualization, high-availability, and enterprise\nscalability.\n",
