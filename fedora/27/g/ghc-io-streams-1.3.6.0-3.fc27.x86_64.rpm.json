Most users will want to import the top-level convenience module\n\"System.IO.Streams\", which re-exports most of the library:\n\nFor first-time users, 'io-streams' comes with an included tutorial, which can\nbe found in the \"System.IO.Streams.Tutorial\" module.\n\n'io-streams' comes with:\n* functions to use files, handles, concurrent channels, sockets, lists,\nvectors, and more as streams.\n* a variety of combinators for wrapping and transforming streams, including\ncompression and decompression using zlib, controlling precisely how many bytes\nare read from or written to a stream, buffering output using bytestring\nbuilders, folds, maps, filters, zips, etc.\n* support for parsing from streams using 'attoparsec'.\n* support for spawning processes and communicating with them using streams.\n",
