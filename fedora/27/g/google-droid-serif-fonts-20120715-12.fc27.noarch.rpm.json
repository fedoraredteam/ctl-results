            "Description": "\n\nThe Droid typeface family was designed in the fall of 2006 by Ascender's\nSteve Matteson, as a commission from Google to create a set of system fonts\nfor its Android platform. The goal was to provide optimal quality and comfort\non a mobile handset when rendered in application menus, web browsers and for\nother screen text.\nThe family was later extended in collaboration with other designers such as\nPascal Zoghbi of 29ArabicLetters.\n\nDroid Serif is a contemporary serif typeface family designed for comfortable\nreading on screen. Droid Serif is slightly condensed to maximize the amount of\ntext displayed on small screens. Vertical stress and open forms contribute to\nits readability while its proportion and overall design complement its\ncompanion Droid Sans.\nThe Arabic block was designed by Pascal Zoghbi of 29ArabicLetters under the\nDroid Naskh name.\n",
