It is based on the idea that if a property holds for a\npartially-defined input then it must also hold for all fully-defined\nrefinements of the that input. Compared to ``eager'' input generation as in\nSmallCheck, Lazy SmallCheck may require significantly fewer test-cases to\nverify a property for all inputs up to a given depth.\n",
