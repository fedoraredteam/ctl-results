Instances are based on monad transformers in\n'MonadTransControl', which includes all standard monad transformers in the\n'transformers' library except 'ContT'.\n\nSee the 'lifted-base' package which uses 'monad-control' to lift 'IO'\noperations from the 'base' library (like 'catch' or 'bracket') into any monad\nthat is an instance of 'MonadBase' or 'MonadBaseControl'.\n",
