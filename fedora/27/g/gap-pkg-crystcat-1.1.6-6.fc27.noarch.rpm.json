            "Description": "\nThe GAP 4 package CrystCat provides a catalog of crystallographic groups\nof dimensions 2, 3, and 4 which covers most of the data contained in the\nbook \"Crystallographic groups of four-dimensional space\" by H. Brown, R.\nB\u00fclow, J. Neub\u00fcser, H. Wondratschek, and H. Zassenhaus (John Wiley, New\nYork, 1978).  This catalog was previously available in the library of\nGAP 3.  The present version for GAP 4 has been moved into a separate\npackage, because it requires the package Cryst, which is loaded\nautomatically by CrystCat.  The benefit of this is that space groups\nextracted from the catalog now have the rich set of methods provided by\nCryst at their disposal, and are no longer dumb lists of generators.\nMoreover, space groups are now fully supported in both the\nrepresentation acting from the left and the representation acting from\nthe right.\n",
