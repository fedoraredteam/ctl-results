            "Description": "\nThis project is for the Generic JMS JCA Resource Adapter for JBoss AS. As the\nname suggests, this JCA RA provides the ability to integrate with any JMS\nbroker which allows remote clients to look-up connection factories and\ndestinations via JNDI (as outlined in section 4.2 of the JMS 1.1\nspecification). It currently is only verified to work in JBoss AS7 and\nsupports, for example, consuming messages with an MDB and sending messages with\na JCA-base JMS connection factory to 3rd-party brokers. It is based on the\ngeneric JMS JCA RA found in previous versions of JBoss AS (e.g. 4, 5, and 6).\nHowever, unlike those versions this is a stand-alone project now and no longer\nsupports internal dead-letter processing since every modern JMS broker supports\nthis already.\n",
