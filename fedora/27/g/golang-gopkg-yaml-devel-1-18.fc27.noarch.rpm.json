It was developed within Canonical as part of the juju project, and\nis based on a pure Go port of the well-known libyaml C library to parse and\ngenerate YAML data quickly and reliably.\n\nThe yaml package is almost compatible with YAML 1.1, including support for\nanchors, tags, etc. There are still a few missing bits, such as document\nmerging, base-60 floats (huh?), and multi-document unmarshalling. These\nfeatures are not hard to add, and will be introduced as necessary.\n\nThis package contains library source intended for\nbuilding other packages which use import path with\ngopkg.in/v1/yaml prefix.\n",
