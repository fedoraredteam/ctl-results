            "Description": "\nThis library provides an implementation of the older blaze-builder interface in\nterms of the new builder that shipped with bytestring-0.10.4.0\n\nThis implementation is mostly intended as a bridge to the new builder, so that\ncode that uses the old interface can interoperate with code that uses the new\nimplementation. Note that no attempt has been made to preserve the old internal\nmodules, so code that has these dependencies cannot use this interface.\n\nNew code should, for the most part, use the new interface. However, this module\ndoes implement a chunked HTTP encoding, which is not otherwise implemented\n(yet?) with the new builder.\n",
