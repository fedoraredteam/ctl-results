            "Description": "\nAroania is a modern recast of Victor Scholderer's \"New Hellenic\" font, on the\nbasis of Verdana. In 1927, Victor Julius Scholderer (1880-1971), on behalf of\nthe \"Society for the Promotion of Greek Studies\", got involved in choosing and\nconsulting the design and production of a Greek type called \"New Hellenic\", cut\nby the Lanston Monotype Corporation. He chose the revival of a round, and\nalmost monoline type which had first appeared in 1492 in the edition of\nMacrobius, ascribable to the printing shop of Giovanni Rosso (Joannes Rubeus)\nin Venice.\n\nThe font covers the Windows Glyph List, IPA Extensions, Greek Extended, Ancient\nGreek Numbers, Byzantine and Ancient Greek Musical Notation, various\ntypographic extras and several Open Type features (Case-Sensitive Forms, Small\nCapitals, Subscript, Superscript, Numerators, Denominators, Fractions, Old\nStyle Figures, Historical Forms, Stylistic Alternates, Ligatures).\n\nIt was created by George Douros.\n",
