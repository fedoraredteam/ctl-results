            "Description": "\nThis package provides a higher-level interface over threads, in which an\n'Async a' is a concurrent thread that will eventually deliver a value of\ntype 'a'. The package provides ways to create \"Async\" computations,\nwait for their results, and cancel them.\n\nUsing 'Async' is safer than using threads in two ways:\n\n* When waiting for a thread to return a result, if the thread dies with an\nexception then the caller must either re-throw the exception ('wait') or handle\nit ('waitCatch'); the exception cannot be ignored.\n\n* The API makes it possible to build a tree of threads that are automatically\nkilled when their parent dies (see 'withAsync').\n",
