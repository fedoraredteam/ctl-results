It can inspect your application, giving you detailed\ninformation on your UI, such as the hierarchy, X window IDs, widget\nproperties, and more. You can modify properties on the fly in order to\nexperiment with the look of your UI.\n\nParasite includes an embedded Python shell that lets you write new code that\ndirectly interacts with your application's UI, regardless of the language the\napplication is written in. Create new dialogs, attach temporary signal\nhandlers to buttons, test out new logic, and gather additional debug\ninformation.\n",
