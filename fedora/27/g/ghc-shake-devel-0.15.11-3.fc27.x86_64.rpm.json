Thanks to do notation and infix\noperators, a simple Shake build system is not too dissimilar from a simple\nMakefile. However, as build systems get more complex, Shake is able to take\nadvantage of the excellent abstraction facilities offered by Haskell and easily\nsupport much larger projects. The Shake library provides all the standard\nfeatures available in other build systems, including automatic parallelism and\nminimal rebuilds. Shake also provides more accurate dependency tracking,\nincluding seamless support for generated files, and dependencies on system\ninformation (e.g. compiler version).\n",
