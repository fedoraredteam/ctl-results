            "Description": "\nIn England, during the 1790\u2019s, Cambridge University Press decided to procure a\nnew set of Greek types. The university\u2019s great scholar of Classics, Richard\nPorson was asked to produce a typeface based on his handsome handwriting and\nRichard Austin was commissioned to cut the types. The type was completed in\n1808, after the untimely death of Porson the previous year. Its success was\nimmediate and since then the classical editions in Great Britain and the\nU.S.A. use it, almost invariably.\n\nIn 1913, Monotype released the typeface with some corrections, notably\nreplacing the upright capitals suggested by Porson with inclined ones. In\nGreece the typeface was used under the name Pelasgika type.\n\nGFS Porson is based on the Monotype version, though using upright capitals, as\nin the original.\n",
