            "Description": "\n\nGinga is a toolkit designed for building viewers for scientific image data in\nPython, visualizing 2D pixel data in numpy arrays. It can view astronomical\ndata such as contained in files based on the FITS (Flexible Image Transport\nSystem) file format. It is written and is maintained by software engineers at\nthe Subaru Telescope, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.\n\nThe Ginga toolkit centers around an image display class which supports zooming\nand panning, color and intensity mapping, a choice of several automatic cut\nlevels algorithms and canvases for plotting scalable geometric forms. In\naddition to this widget, a general purpose \u201creference\u201d FITS viewer is\nprovided, based on a plugin framework. A fairly complete set of standard\nplugins are provided for features that we expect from a modern FITS viewer:\npanning and zooming windows, star catalog access, cuts, star pick/fwhm,\nthumbnails, etc.\n",
