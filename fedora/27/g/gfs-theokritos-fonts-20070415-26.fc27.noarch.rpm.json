            "Description": "\nYannis Kefallinos (1894\u20131958) was one of the most innovative engravers of his\ngeneration and the first who researched methodicaly the aesthetics of book and\ntypographic design in Greece. He taught at the Fine Arts School of Athens and\nestablished the first book design workshop from which many practising artists\nof the 60's and 70's had graduated.\n\nIn the late 50's Kefallinos designed and published an exquisite book with\nengraved illustrations of the ancient white funerary pottery in Attica in\ncollaboration with Varlamos, Montesanto, Damianakis. For the text of\nKefallinos' \u0394\u03ad\u03ba\u03b1 \u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03b1\u03af \u03bb\u03ae\u03ba\u03c5\u03b8\u03bf\u03b9 (1956) the artist used a typeface which he\nhimself had designed a few years before for an unrealised edition of\nTheocritos' Idyls. Its complex and heavily decorative design does point to\naesthetic codes which preoccupied his artistic expression and, although\nimpractical for contemporary text setting, it remains an original display\nface, or it can be used as initials.\n\nThe book design workshop of the Fine Arts School of Athens has been recently\nreorganised, under the direction of professor Leoni Vidali, and with her\ncollaboration George D. Matthiopoulos has redesigned digitaly this historical\nfont which is now available as GFS Theokritos.\n",
