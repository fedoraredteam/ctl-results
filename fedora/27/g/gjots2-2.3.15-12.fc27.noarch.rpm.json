I use\nit for all my notes on Unix, my personal bits and pieces, recipes and\neven PINs and passwords (encrypted with ccrypt(1)).\n\nYou can also use it to \"mind-map\" your compositions - write down all\nyour thoughts and then start to organise them into a tree. By\nmanipulating the tree you can easily reorder your thoughts and\nstructure them appropriately.\n",
