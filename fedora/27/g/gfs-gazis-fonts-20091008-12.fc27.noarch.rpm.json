            "Description": "\nDuring the whole of the 18th century the old tradition of using Greek types\ndesigned to conform to the Byzantine cursive hand with many ligatures and\nabbreviations - as it was originated by Aldus Manutius in Venice and\nconsolidated by Claude Garamont (Grecs du Roy) - was still much in practice,\nalthough clearly on the wane.\n\nGFS Gazis is a typical German example of this practice as it appeared at the\nend of that era in the 1790's. Its name pays tribute to Anthimos Gazis\n(1758-1828), one of the most prolific Greek thinkers of the period, who was\nresponsible for writing, translating and editing numerous books, including the\neditorship of the important Greek periodical \u0395\u03c1\u03bc\u03ae\u03c2 \u03bf \u039b\u03cc\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (Litterary Hermes)\nin Wien.\n\nGFS Gazis has been digitally designed by George D. Matthiopoulos.\n",
