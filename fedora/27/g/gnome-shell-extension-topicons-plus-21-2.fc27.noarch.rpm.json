However, the Legacy Tray is hidden until you push your mouse into the\nlower-left of the screen and click on the small tab that appears. TopIcons Plus\nbrings all icons back to the top panel, so that it's easier to keep track of\napps running in the background. You also get some options to control the look\nand feel: You can leave the icons in full color, or dynamically convert them to\ngrayscale, etc.\n",
