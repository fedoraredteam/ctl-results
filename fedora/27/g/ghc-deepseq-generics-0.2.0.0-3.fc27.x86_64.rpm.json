See the documentation for the 'genericRnf' function in\nthe \"Control.DeepSeq.Generics\" module to get started.\n\nThe original idea was pioneered in the 'generic-deepseq' package (see\n<http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2012-February/099551.html> for\nmore information).\n\nThis package differs from the 'generic-deepseq' package by working in\ncombination with the existing 'deepseq' package as opposed to defining a\nconflicting drop-in replacement for 'deepseq's 'Control.Deepseq' module.\n\nNote: The ability to auto-derive via \"GHC.Generics\" has been merged into\n'deepseq-1.4.0.0'. This package is now still useful for writing code that's\nalso compatible with older 'deepseq' versions not yet providing\n\"GHC.Generics\"-support.\n",
