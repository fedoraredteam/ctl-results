            "Description": "\nThis package provides parsing and rendering functions for XML. It is\nbased on the datatypes found in the xml-types package. This package is\nbroken up into the following modules:\n\n* Text.XML: DOM-based parsing and rendering.\n  This is the most commonly used module.\n\n* Text.XML.Cursor: A wrapper around Text.XML which allows bidirectional\n  traversing of the DOM, similar to XPath. (Note: Text.XML.Cursor.Generic\n  is the same concept, but will work with any node representation.)\n\n* Text.XML.Unresolved: A slight modification  to Text.XML which does not\n  require  all entities  to be  resolved at  parsing. The  datatypes are\n  slightly  more complicated  here, and  therefore this  module is  only\n  recommended when you need to deal directly with raw entities.\n\n* Text.XML.Stream.Parse: Streaming parser, including some streaming\n  parser combinators.\n\n* Text.XML.Stream.Render: Streaming renderer.\n",
