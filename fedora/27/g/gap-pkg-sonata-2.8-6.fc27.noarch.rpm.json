            "Description": "\nSONATA stands for \"systems of nearrings and their applications\".  It\nprovides methods for the construction and the analysis of finite\nnearrings.  A left nearring is an algebra (N;+,*), where (N,+) is a (not\nnecessarily abelian) group, (N,*) is a semigroup, and x*(y+z) = x*y + x*z\nholds for all x,y,z in N.\n\nAs a typical example of a nearring, we may consider the set of all\nmappings from a group G into G, where the addition is the pointwise\naddition of mappings in G, and the multiplication is composition of\nfunctions.  If functions are written on the right of their arguments,\nthen the left distributive law holds, while the right distributive law\nis not satisfied for non-trivial G.\n\nThe SONATA package provides methods for the construction and analysis of\nfinite nearrings.\n1. Methods for constructing all endomorphisms and all fixed-point-free\n   automorphisms of a given group.\n2. Methods for constructing the following nearrings of functions on a\n   group G:\n   - the nearring of polynomial functions of G (in the sense of\n     Lausch-N\u00f6bauer);\n   - the nearring of compatible functions of G;\n   - distributively generated nearrings such as I(G), A(G), E(G);\n   - centralizer nearrings.\n3. A library of all small nearrings (up to order 15) and all small\n   nearrings with identity (up to order 31).\n4. Functions to obtain solvable fixed-point-free automorphism groups on\n   abelian groups, nearfields, planar nearrings, as well as designs from\n   those.\n5. Various functions to study the structure (size, ideals, N-groups, ...)\n   of nearrings, to determine properties of nearring elements, and to\n   decide whether two nearrings are isomorphic.\n6. If the package XGAP is installed, the lattices of one- and two-sided\n   ideals of a nearring can be studied interactively using a graphical\n   representation.\n",
