            "Description": "\nThe ancient Greek alphabet evolved during the millenium of the Byzantine era\nfrom majuscule to minuscule form and gradually incorporated a wide array of\nligatures, flourishes and other decorative nuances which defined its\nextravagant cursive character. Until the late 15th century, typographers who\nhad to deal with Greek text avoided emulating this complicated hand; instead\nthey would use only the twenty four letters of the alphabet separately, often\nwithout accents and other diacritics.\n\nA celebrated example is the type cut and cast for the typesetting of the New\nTestament in the so-called Complutensian Polyglot Bible (1512), edited by the\nGreek scholar, Demetrios Doukas. The type was cut by Arnaldo Guill\u00e9n de Brocar\nand the whole edition was a commision by cardinal Francisco Xim\u00e9nez, in the\nUniversity of Alcal\u00e1 (Complutum), Spain. It is one of the best and most\nrepresentative models of this early tradition in Greek typography which was\nrevived in the early 20th century by the eminent bibliographer of the British\nLibrary, Richard Proctor. A font named Otter Greek was cut in 1903 and a book\nwas printed using the new type. The original type had no capitals so Proctor\nadded his own, which were rather large and ill-fitted. The early death of\nProctor, the big size of the font and the different aesthetic notions of the\ntime were the reasons that Otter Greek was destined to oblivion, as a\ncuriosity.\n\nGreek Font Society incorporated Brocar's famous and distinctive type in the\ncommemorative edition of Pindar's Odes for the Athens Olympics (2004) and the\ntype with a new set of capitals, revived digitaly by George D. Matthiopoulos,\nis now available for general use.\n",
