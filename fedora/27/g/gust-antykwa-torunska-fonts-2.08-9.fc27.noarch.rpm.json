            "Description": "\nAntykwa Toru\u0144ska (meaning just \"Antiqua of Torun\") is a two-element\ntypeface designed by Zygfryd Gardzielewski in the 50\u2019s.\n\nThe font is mainly used for typesetting of small prints. Its\ncharacteristic features are the widening of vertical stems at the top\nand the wave-like form of some of the horizontal and diagonal lines as\nwell as of the serifs.\n\nThe current version contains a greatly extended character set (e.g.,\ncyrillic, greek, most often used mathematical symbols and currency\nsymbols, additional ligatures) compared to the original, as well as\nadditional typefaces (light, regular, medium and bold in normal and\ncondensed widths).\n",
