They were designed\nto be able to fully describe C interfaces, so that hsc2hs can extract from them\nall Haskell code needed to mimic such interfaces. All Haskell names used are\nautomatically derived from C names, structures are mapped to Haskell instances\nof Storable, and there are also macros you can use with C code to help write\nbindings to inline functions or macro functions. Documentation is available at\npackage homepage:\n\n<https://github.com/jwiegley/bindings-dsl/wiki>\n\nThe extra module Bindings.Utilities will contain tools that may be convenient\nwhen working with FFI.\n",
