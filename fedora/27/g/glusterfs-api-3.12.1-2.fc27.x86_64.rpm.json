It aggregates various storage bricks over Infiniband RDMA\nor TCP/IP interconnect into one large parallel network file\nsystem. GlusterFS is one of the most sophisticated file systems in\nterms of features and extensibility.  It borrows a powerful concept\ncalled Translators from GNU Hurd kernel. Much of the code in GlusterFS\nis in user space and easily manageable.\n\nThis package provides the glusterfs libgfapi library.\n",
