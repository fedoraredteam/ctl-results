By using the library, we can parse derived 'Show' instances into a\ngeneric data structure. The 'ppsh' tool uses the library to produce\nhuman-readable versions of 'Show' instances, which can be quite handy for\ndebugging Haskell programs. We can also render complex generic values into an\ninteractive Html page, for easier examination.\n",
