            "Description": "\nA collection of various methods for splitting lists into parts, akin to the\n\"split\" function found in several mainstream languages. Here is its tale:\n\nOnce upon a time the standard \"Data.List\" module held no function for splitting\na list into parts according to a delimiter. Many a brave lambda-knight strove\nto add such a function, but their striving was in vain, for Lo, the Supreme\nCouncil fell to bickering amongst themselves what was to be the essential\nnature of the One True Function which could cleave a list in twain (or thrain,\nor any required number of parts).\n\nAnd thus came to pass the split package, comprising divers functions for\nsplitting a list asunder, each according to its nature. And the Supreme Council\nhad no longer any grounds for argument, for the favored method of each was\ncontained therein.\n\nTo get started, see the \"Data.List.Split\" module.\n",
