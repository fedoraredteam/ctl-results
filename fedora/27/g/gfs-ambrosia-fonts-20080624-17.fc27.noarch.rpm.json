            "Description": "\nAs it is known, the Greek alphabet was used in majuscule form for over a\nmillennium before the minuscule letters gradually replaced it until they became\nthe official script in the 9th century A.D. Thereafter, majuscule letters were\nconfined to sparse use as initials or elaborate titles until the Italian\nRenaissance.\n\nThe new art of Typography, as well as the need of the humanists to mimic the\nancient Greco-Roman period brought back the extensive use of the majuscule\nletter-forms in both Latin and Greek typography. Greek books of the time were\nprinted using the contemporary Byzantine hand with which they combined capital\nletters modelled on the Roman antiquity, i.e. with thick and thin strokes and\nserifs. At the same time the Byzantine majuscule tradition, principally used on\ntheological editions, remainned alive until the early 19th century.\n\nGFS Ambrosia has the main characteristics of the majuscule forms of the early\nChristian tradition.\n\nIt has been designed by George D. Matthiopoulos.\n",
