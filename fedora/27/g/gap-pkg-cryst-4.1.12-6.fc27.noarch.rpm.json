            "Description": "\nThe GAP 4 package Cryst, previously known as CrystGAP, is the successor\nof the CrystGAP package for GAP 3.  During the porting process to GAP 4,\nlarge parts of the code have been rewritten, and the functionality has\nbeen extended considerably.  Cryst provides a rich set of methods to\ncompute with affine crystallographic groups, in particular space groups.\nIn contrast to the GAP 3 version, affine crystallographic groups are now\nfully supported both in the representation acting from the right and in\nthe representation acting from the left.  The latter representation is\nthe one preferred by crystallographers.  There are also functions to\ndetermine representatives of all space group types of a given dimension.\n",
