            "Description": "\nCRISP (Computing with Radicals, Injectors, Schunck classes and\nProjectors) provides algorithms for computing subgroups of finite\nsoluble groups related to group classes.  In particular, it allows to\ncompute F-radicals and F-injectors for Fitting classes (and Fitting\nsets) F, F-residuals for formations F, and X-projectors for Schunck\nclasses X.  In order to carry out these computations, the group classes\nF and X must be given by an algorithm which decides membership in the\ngroup class.\n\nMoreover, CRISP contains algorithms for the computation of normal\nsubgroups invariant under a prescribed set of automorphisms and\nbelonging to a given group class.  This includes an improved method to\ncompute the set of all normal subgroups of a finite soluble group, its\ncharacteristic subgroups, and the socle and p-socles for given primes p.\n",
