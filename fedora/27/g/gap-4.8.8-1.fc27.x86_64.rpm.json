GAP provides a programming\nlanguage, a library of thousands of functions implementing algebraic\nalgorithms written in the GAP language as well as large data libraries\nof algebraic objects.  GAP is used in research and teaching for studying\ngroups and their representations, rings, vector spaces, algebras,\ncombinatorial structures, and more.\n\nThis is a metapackage that requires the standard GAP components.\n",
