GNU MP is designed for speed, for both small and very\nlarge operands. GNU MP is fast because it uses fullwords as the basic\narithmetic type, it uses fast algorithms, it carefully optimizes\nassembly code for many CPUs' most common inner loops, and it generally\nemphasizes speed over simplicity/elegance in its operations.\n\nInstall the gmp package if you need a fast arbitrary precision\nlibrary.\n",
