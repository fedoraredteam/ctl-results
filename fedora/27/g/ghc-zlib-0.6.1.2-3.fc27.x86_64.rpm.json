It uses the\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib zlib C library> so it has high performance.\nIt supports the \"zlib\", \"gzip\" and \"raw\" compression formats.\n\nIt provides a convenient high level API suitable for most tasks and for the few\ncases where more control is needed it provides access to the full zlib feature\nset.\n",
