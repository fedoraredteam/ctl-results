It is\nalso possible to test if a semigroup satisfies a particular property,\nsuch as if it is regular, simple, inverse, completely regular, and a\nvariety of further properties.\n\nThere are methods for finding congruences of certain types of\nsemigroups, the normalizer of a semigroup in a permutation group, the\nmaximal subsemigroups of a finite semigroup, and smaller degree partial\npermutation representations of inverse semigroups.  There are functions\nfor producing pictures of the Green's structure of a semigroup, and for\ndrawing bipartitions.\n",
