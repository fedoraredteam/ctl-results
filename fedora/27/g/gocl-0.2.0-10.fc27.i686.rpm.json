It is intended to be a lightweight\nwrapper that adapts OpenCL programming patterns and boilerplate, and\nexpose a simpler API that is known and comfortable to GNOME\ndevelopers. Examples of such adaptations are the integration with\nGLib\u2019s main loop, exposing non-blocking APIs, GError based error\nreporting and full gobject-introspection support. It will also be\nincluding convenient API to simplify code for the most common use\npatterns.\n",
