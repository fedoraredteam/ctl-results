            "Description": "\nProvides a wide array of (semi)groupoids and operations for working with them.\n\nA 'Semigroupoid' is a 'Category' without the requirement of identity arrows for\nevery object in the category.\n\nA 'Category' is any 'Semigroupoid' for which the Yoneda lemma holds.\n\nWhen working with comonads you often have the '<*>' portion of an\n'Applicative', but not the 'pure'. This was captured in Uustalu and Vene's\n\"Essence of Dataflow Programming\" in the form of the 'ComonadZip' class in the\ndays before 'Applicative'. Apply provides a weaker invariant, but for the\ncomonads used for data flow programming (found in the streams package), this\ninvariant is preserved. Applicative function composition forms a semigroupoid.\n",
