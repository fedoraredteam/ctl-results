            "Description": "\nMany applications, such as chat clients, downloaders, and some media players,\nare meant to run long-term in the background even after you close their window.\nThese applications remain accessible by adding an icon to the GNOME Shell Legacy\nTray. However, the Legacy Tray is hidden until you push your mouse into the\nlower-left of the screen and click on the small tab that appears. TopIcons Plus\nbrings all icons back to the top panel, so that it's easier to keep track of\napps running in the background. You also get some options to control the look\nand feel: You can leave the icons in full color, or dynamically convert them to\ngrayscale, etc.\n\n**NOTE:** After installing, each user that wants it must still manually enable\nTopIcons Plus before it will take effect. You can do so a few different ways:\n\n* If you've already installed the GNOME Shell integration web browser plugin,\n  go to <https://extensions.gnome.org/local/>, find the extension, and click\n  the switch to \"ON.\"\n* Open GNOME Tweak Tool, go to the Extensions tab, find the extension, and click\n  the switch to \"ON.\"\n* Open a terminal or the desktop's command dialog, and (as your normal user\n  account) run `gnome-shell-extension-tool --enable TopIcons@phocean.net`\n\nYou may also need to restart GNOME Shell (Open the command dialog with Alt-F2,\ntype `r`, and hit enter), or log out and log back in.\n",
