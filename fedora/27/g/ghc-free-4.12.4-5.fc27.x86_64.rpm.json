            "Description": "\nFree monads are useful for many tree-like structures and domain specific\nlanguages.\n\nIf 'f' is a 'Functor' then the free 'Monad' on 'f' is the type of trees whose\nnodes are labeled with the constructors of 'f'. The word \"free\" is used in the\nsense of \"unrestricted\" rather than \"zero-cost\": 'Free f' makes no constraining\nassumptions beyond those given by 'f' and the definition of 'Monad'.\nAs used here it is a standard term from the mathematical theory of adjoint\nfunctors.\n\nCofree comonads are dual to free monads. They provide convenient ways to talk\nabout branching streams and rose-trees, and can be used to annotate syntax\ntrees. The cofree comonad can be seen as a stream parameterized by a 'Functor'\nthat controls its branching factor.\n\nMore information on free monads, including examples, can be found in the\nfollowing blog posts: <http://comonad.com/reader/2008/monads-for-free/>\n<http://comonad.com/reader/2011/free-monads-for-less/>.\n",
