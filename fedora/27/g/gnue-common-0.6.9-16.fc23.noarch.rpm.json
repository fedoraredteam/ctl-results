It implements\na database-abstraction layer that provides support for most major\ndatabases. A builtin XML-to-Object parser and Object-to-XML\nmarshaller are used by Forms, Reports, and Designer to save and\nread Forms/Report definitions to and from an XML file. It also\ndefines and implements an RPC abstraction layer that will allow\nserver processes to define their public methods once and have them\navailable to CORBA, XML-RPC, SOAP, and DCOM clients.\n",
