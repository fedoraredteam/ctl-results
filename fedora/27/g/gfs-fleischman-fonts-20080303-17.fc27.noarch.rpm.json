            "Description": "\nAs it is known, the Greek alphabet was used in majuscule form for over a\nmillennium before the minuscule letters gradually replaced it until they became\nthe official script in the 9th century A.D. Thereafter, majuscule letters were\nconfined to sparse use as initials or elaborate titles until the Italian\nRenaissance.\n\nThe new art of Typography, as well as the need of the humanists to mimic the\nancient Greco-Roman period brought back the extensive use of the majuscule\nletter-forms in both Latin and Greek typography. Greek books of the time were\nprinted using the contemporary Byzantine hand with which they combined capital\nletters modelled on the Roman antiquity, i.e. with thick and thin strokes and\nserifs. At the same time the Byzantine majuscule tradition, principally used on\ntheological editions, remainned alive until the early 19th century.\n\nGFS Fleischman was cut by Johann Michael Fleishman, typecutter of the Dutch\nEnsched\u00e9 foundry and follows the baroque style of the mid-18th century\n\u00e6sthetics.\n\nIt has been designed by George D. Matthiopoulos.\n",
