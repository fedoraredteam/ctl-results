            "Description": "\nGiambattista Bodoni was the most prolific Italian typecutter of the 18th\ncentury. While he worked in the Vatican Press he was involved in the\ntypecutting of \u201cexotic\u201d languages for which catholic literature was printed.\nWhen he established his own press in Parma he did publish many books of the\nclassics with his own Greek typefaces in the last quarter of the 18th century.\nHe was among the first European typecutters to move away from the byzantine\ncursive tradition with the numerous ligatures which was the norm until then.\nHis Greek types influenced many subsequent designers, yet they fell in disuse\nby the middle of the 19th century.\n\nGFS presented Bodoni's original Greek typeface in the commemorative edition of\nPindar's Olympian Odes (2004), in digital version by George D. Matthiopoulos,\nand is now available as free ware for the general public. In the OpenType\nfeatures, under ligatures, one may alternately use diphthongs with the accents\nplaced in between the characters, as Giambattista Bodoni did when setting\ngreek texts.\n",
