Before the advent of the\nJava New I/O API (NIO), thread management issues made it\nimpossible for a server to scale to thousands of users. The\nGrizzly framework has been designed to help developers to take\nadvantage of the Java NIO API. Originally developed under the\nGlassFish umbrella, the framework is now available as a\nstandalone project. Grizzly goals is to help developers to\nbuild scalable and robust servers using NIO.\n",
