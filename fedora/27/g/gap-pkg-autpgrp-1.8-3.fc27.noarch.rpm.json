            "Description": "\nThe AutPGrp package introduces a new function to compute the\nautomorphism group of a finite p-group.  The underlying algorithm is a\nrefinement of the methods described in O'Brien (1995).  In particular,\nthis implementation is more efficient in both time and space\nrequirements and hence has a wider range of applications than the ANUPQ\nmethod.  Our package is written in GAP code and it makes use of a\nnumber of methods from the GAP library such as the MeatAxe for matrix\ngroups and permutation group functions.  We have compared our method to\nthe others available in GAP.  Our package usually out-performs all but\nthe method designed for finite abelian groups.  We note that our method\nuses the small groups library in certain cases and hence our algorithm\nis more effective if the small groups library is installed.\n",
