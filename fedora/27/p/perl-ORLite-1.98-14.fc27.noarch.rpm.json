            "Description": "\nSQLite is a light weight single file SQL database that provides\nan excellent platform for embedded storage of structured data.\nHowever, while it is superficially similar to a regular server-side\nSQL database, SQLite has some significant attributes that make using\nit like a traditional database difficult. For example, SQLite is\nextremely fast to connect to compared to server databases\n(1000 connections per second is not unknown) and is particularly bad\nat concurrency, as it can only lock transactions at a database-wide level.\nThis role as a super-fast internal data store can clash with the roles and\ndesigns of traditional object-relational modules like Class::DBI or\nDBIx::Class. What this situation would seem to need is an object-relation\nsystem that is designed specifically for SQLite and is aligned with its\nidiosyncrasies. ORLite is an object-relation system specifically\nfor SQLite that follows many of the same principles as the ::Tiny\nseries of modules and has a design that aligns directly to the capabilities\nof SQLite.\n",
