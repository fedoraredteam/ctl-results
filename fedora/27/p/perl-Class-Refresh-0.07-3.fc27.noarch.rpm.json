            "Description": "\nDuring development, it is fairly common to cycle between writing code and\ntesting that code. Generally the testing happens within the test suite, but\nfrequently it is more convenient to test things by hand when tracking down\na bug, or when doing some exploratory coding. In many situations, however,\nthis becomes inconvenient - for instance, in a REPL, or in a stateful web\napplication, restarting from the beginning after every code change can get\npretty tedious. This module allows you to reload your application classes\non the fly, so that the code/test cycle becomes a lot easier.\n",
