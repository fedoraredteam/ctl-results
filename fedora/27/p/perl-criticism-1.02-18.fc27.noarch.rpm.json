In a\nproduction system, this usually isn't feasible because it adds a lot of\noverhead at start-up. If you have a separate development environment, you\ncan effectively bypass the criticism pragma by not installing Perl::Critic\nin the production environment. If Perl::Critic can't be loaded, then\ncriticism just fails silently.\n",
