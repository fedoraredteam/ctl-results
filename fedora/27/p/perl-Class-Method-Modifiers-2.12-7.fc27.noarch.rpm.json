            "Description": "\nMethod modifiers are a powerful feature from the CLOS (Common Lisp Object\nSystem) world.\n\nIn its most basic form, a method modifier is just a method that calls\n'$self->SUPER::foo(@_)'. I for one have trouble remembering that exact\ninvocation, so my classes seldom re-dispatch to their base classes. Very\nbad!\n\n'Class::Method::Modifiers' provides three modifiers: 'before', 'around',\nand 'after'. 'before' and 'after' are run just before and after the method\nthey modify, but can not really affect that original method. 'around' is\nrun in place of the original method, with a hook to easily call that\noriginal method. See the 'MODIFIERS' section for more details on how the\nparticular modifiers work.\n",
