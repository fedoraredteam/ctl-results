            "Description": "\npython-sanction is a lightweight, dead simple client implementation of\nthe OAuth2 protocol.\n\n- Variations on OAuth2 client implementation range from a few hundred LOC\n  to thousands. In a Pythonic world, there's absolutely no need for this when\n  simply dealing with the client side of the spec. Currently, sanction sits\n  at a whopping 65 LOC, one class. This makes the library tremendously easy\n  to grok.\n\n- Most providers have varying levels of diversion from the official spec.\n  The goal with this library is to either handle these diversions natively,\n  or expose a method to allow client code to deal with it efficiently and\n  effectively.\n\n- Three of the four OAuth2 flows should be supported by this library.\n  Currently, only authorization code and client credential flows have been\n  tested due to lack of other (known) implementations.\n\nsanction has been tested with the following OAuth2 providers:\n\n* Facebook (include the test API)\n* Google\n* Foursquare\n* bitly\n* GitHub\n* StackExchange\n* Instagram\n* DeviantArt\n",
