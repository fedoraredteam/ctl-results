            "Description": "\nPOE is a framework for cooperative, event driven multitasking in Perl.\nOther languages have similar frameworks. Python has Twisted. TCL has \"the\nevent loop\".\n\nPOE originally was developed as the core of a persistent object server and\nrun-time environment. It has evolved into a general purpose multitasking\nand networking framework, encompassing and providing a consistent interface\nto other event loops such as Event and the Tk and GTK toolkits.\n\nPOE is written in layers, each building upon the previous. It's therefore\npossible to use POE at varying levels of abstraction.\n",
