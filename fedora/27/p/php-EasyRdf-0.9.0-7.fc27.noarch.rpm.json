            "Description": "\nEasyRdf is a PHP library designed to make it easy to consume and produce RDF\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework). It was designed\nfor use in mixed teams of experienced and inexperienced RDF developers. It is\nwritten in Object Oriented PHP and has been tested extensively using PHPUnit.\n\nAfter parsing EasyRdf builds up a graph of PHP objects that can then be walked\naround to get the data to be placed on the page. Dump methods are available to\ninspect what data is available during development.\n\nData is typically loaded into a EasyRdf_Graph object from source RDF documents,\nloaded from the web via HTTP. The EasyRdf_GraphStore class simplifies loading\nand saving data to a SPARQL 1.1 Graph Store.\n\nSPARQL queries can be made over HTTP to a Triplestore using the\nEasyRdf_Sparql_Client class. SELECT and ASK queries will return an\nEasyRdf_Sparql_Result object and CONSTRUCT and DESCRIBE queries will\nreturn an EasyRdf_Graph object.\n\nAutoloader: /usr/share/php/EasyRdf/autoload.php\n",
