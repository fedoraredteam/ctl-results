            "Description": "\nThere are several other modules to do this, you probably want one of them. This\nmodule exists as a super-specialized parallel task manager. You create the\nobject with a process limit and callbacks for what to do while waiting for a\nfree process slot, as well as a callback for what a process should do just\nbefore exiting.\n\nYou must explicitly call $runner->finish() when you are done. If the runner is\ndestroyed before its children are finished, a warning will be generated and\nyour child processes will be killed, by force if necessary.\n\nIf you specify a maximum of 1 then no forking will occur, and run() will block\nuntil the coderef returns. You can force a fork by providing a boolean true\nvalue as the second argument to run(), which will force the runner to fork\nbefore running the coderef; however, run() will still block until the child\nexits.\n",
