It tries to be as non-intrusive as possible -\nwhen this module is used, inheriting from non-Moose classes and inheriting\nfrom Moose classes should work identically, aside from the few caveats\nmentioned below. One of the goals of this module is that including it in a\nMoose::Exporter-based package used across an entire application should be\npossible, without interfering with classes that only inherit from Moose\nmodules, or even classes that don't inherit from anything at all.\n",
