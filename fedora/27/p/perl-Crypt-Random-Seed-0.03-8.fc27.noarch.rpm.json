The main purpose of this\nmodule is to provide a simple way to generate a seed for a PRNG such as\nMath::Random::ISAAC, for use in cryptographic key generation, or as the\nseed for an upstream module such as Bytes::Random::Secure. Flags for\nrequiring non-blocking sources are allowed, as well as a very simple method\nfor plugging in a source.\n",
