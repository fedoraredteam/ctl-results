            "Description": "\nHTML_Template_IT:\nThe Isotemplate API is somewhat tricky for a beginner although it is the\nbest one you can build.\n\nSource and target can be block names or even handler names. This API gives\nyou a maximum of flexibility but you always have to know what you do which\nis quite unusual for php developer like me.\nIf all blocks are within one file, the script knows how they are nested and\nin which way you have to parse them. IT knows that inner1 is a child of\nblock2, there's no need to tell him about this.\n\nFeatures :\n  * Nested blocks\n  * Include external file\n  * Custom tags format\n\nHTML_Template_ITX :\nWith this class you get the full power of the php lib template class.\nYou may have one file with blocks in it but you have as well one main file\nand multiple files one for each block. This is quite useful when you have\nuser configurable websites. Using blocks not in the main template allows\nyou to modify some parts of your layout easily.\n",
