There are theoretical and practical advantages\nto the functional style:\n\n  - Formal provability\n  - Modularity\n  - Composability\n  - Ease of debugging and testing\n\nFn.py library provides you with missing \"batteries\" to get maximum from\nfunctional approach even in mostly-imperative program.\n",
