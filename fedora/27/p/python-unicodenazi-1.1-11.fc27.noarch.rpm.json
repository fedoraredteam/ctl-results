It's annoying as hell, has a huge runtime impact on performance, and\nwill also complain about most of the stuff in the Python standard library.  But\nit will point out some areas of your code that may traceback in python2 when\ngiven different data and make it easier to migrate to python3 where unicode and\nbytes no longer interoperate.\n",
