Its metaphor for the\ncomputer is as a human-like conversation-partner, and as each\nquestion/response is completed it is summarised onto one line, and remains\non screen, so that the history of the session gradually accumulates on the\nscreen and is available for review, or for cut/paste. This user interface\ncan therefore be intermixed with standard applications which write to\nSTDOUT or STDERR, such as make, pgp, rcs etc.\n",
