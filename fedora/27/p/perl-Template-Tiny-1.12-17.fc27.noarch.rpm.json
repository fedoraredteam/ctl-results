It is intended for use in\nlight-usage, low-memory, or low-CPU templating situations, where you may\nneed to upgrade to the full feature set in the future, or if you want the\nfamiliarity of TT-style templates. It is intended to have fully-compatible\ntemplate and stash usage, with a limited by similar Perl API. Unlike\nTemplate Toolkit, Template::Tiny will process templates without a compile\nphase (but despite this is still quicker, owing to heavy use of the Perl\nregular expression engine.\n",
