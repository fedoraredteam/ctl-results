            "Description": "\nThe value of RDMS for Prolog is often over-estimated, as Prolog itself can\nmanage substantial amounts of data. Nevertheless a Prolog/RDMS interface\nprovides advantages if data is already provided in an RDMS, data must be\nshared with other applications, there are strong persistency requirements\nor there is too much data to fit in memory.\n\nThe popularity of ODBC makes it possible to design a single\nforeign-language module that provides RDMS access for a wide variety of\ndatabases on a wide variety of platforms. The SWI-Prolog RDMS interface is\nclosely modeled after the ODBC API. This API is rather low-level, but\ndefaults and dynamic typing provided by Prolog give the user quite simple\naccess to RDMS, while the interface provides the best possible performance\ngiven the RDMS independency constraint.\n",
