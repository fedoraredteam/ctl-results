            "Description": "\nThis module was inspired by HTML::FormatText::WithLinks which has proven to\nbe a useful \"lynx -dump\" work-alike. However one frustration was that no\nother HTML converters I came across had the ability to deal effectively\nwith HTML <TABLE>s. This module can in a rudimentary sense do so. The aim\nwas to provide facility to take a simple HTML based email template, and to\nalso convert it to text with the <TABLE> structure intact for inclusion as\n\"multi-part/alternative\" content. Further, it will preserve both the\nformatting specified by the <TD> tag's \"align\" attribute, and will also\npreserve multi-line text inside of a <TD> element provided it is broken\nusing <BR/> tags.\n",
