            "Description": "\nTestML <http://www.testml.org/> is a generic, programming language agnostic,\nmeta language for writing unit tests. The idea is that you can use the same\ntest files in multiple implementations of a given programming idea. Then you\ncan be more certain that your application written in, say, Python matches your\nPerl implementation.\n\nIn a nutshell you write a bunch of data tests that have inputs and expected\nresults. Using a simple syntax, you specify what functions the data must pass\nthrough to produce the expected results. You use a bridge class to write the\ndata functions that pass the data through your application.\n\nIn Perl 5, TestML module is the evolution of the Test::Base module. It has\na superset of Test:Base's goals. The data markup syntax is currently exactly\nthe same as Test::Base.\n",
