It is an alternative to PDFtk.\n\nFrom the project git page:\n\nPhilip Stark found pypdf, a PDF library written in pure Python. He\ncouldn't find a tool which actually used the library, so he started\nwriting his own.\n\nThis version of stapler is Fred Wenzel's fork of the project, with\na completely refactored source code, tests, and added functionality.\n",
