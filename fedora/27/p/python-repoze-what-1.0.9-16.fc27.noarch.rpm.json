            "Description": "\n`repoze.what` is an `authorization framework` for WSGI applications,\nbased on `repoze.who` (which deals with `authentication`).\n\nOn the one hand, it enables an authorization system based on the groups to\nwhich the `authenticated or anonymous` user belongs and the permissions granted\nto such groups by loading these groups and permissions into the request on the\nway in to the downstream WSGI application.\n\nAnd on the other hand, it enables you to manage your groups and permissions\nfrom the application itself or another program, under a backend-independent\nAPI. For example, it would be easy for you to switch from one back-end to\nanother, and even use this framework to migrate the data.\n\nIt's highly extensible, so it's very unlikely that it will get in your way.\nAmong other things, you can extend it to check for many other conditions (such\nas checking that the user comes from a given country, based on her IP address,\nfor example).\n",
