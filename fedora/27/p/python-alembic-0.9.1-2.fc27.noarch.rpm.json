            "Description": "\nAlembic is a new database migrations tool, written by the author of\nSQLAlchemy.  A migrations tool offers the following functionality:\n\n* Can emit ALTER statements to a database in order to change the structure\n  of tables and other constructs.\n* Provides a system whereby \"migration scripts\" may be constructed; each script\n  indicates a particular series of steps that can \"upgrade\" a target database\n  to a new version, and optionally a series of steps that can \"downgrade\"\n  similarly, doing the same steps in reverse.\n* Allows the scripts to execute in some sequential manner.\n\nDocumentation and status of Alembic is at http://readthedocs.org/docs/alembic/\n",
