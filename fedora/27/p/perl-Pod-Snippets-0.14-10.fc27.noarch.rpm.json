            "Description": "\nThis class is a very simple extension of Pod::Parser that extracts POD\nsnippets from Perl code, and pretty-prints it so as to make it usable from\nother Perl code. As demonstrated above, Pod::Snippets is immediately useful\nto test-driven-development nutcases who want to put every single line of\nPerl code under test, including code that is in the POD (typically a\nSYNOPSIS section). There are other uses, such as storing a piece of\ninformation that is both human- and machine-readable (e.g. an XML schema)\nsimultaneously as documentation and code.\n",
