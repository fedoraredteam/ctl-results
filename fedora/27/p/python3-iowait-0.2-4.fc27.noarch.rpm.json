For cross-platform\napplications it can be a pain to support all this system functions, especially\nbecause each one provides a different interface.\n\nIOWait solves this problem by providing a unified interface and using always\nthe best and faster function available in the platform. Its only limitation\nis that, on Windows, it only works for sockets.\n\nPython 3 version.\n",
