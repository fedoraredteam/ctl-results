            "Description": "\nClass::DBI::Plugin is an abstract base class for Class::DBI plugins. Its\npurpose is to make writing plugins easier. Writers of plugins should be able\nto concentrate on the functionality their module provides, instead of having\nto deal with the symbol table hackery involved when writing a plugin module.\nOnly three things must be remembered:\n\n* All methods to be exported are given the \"Plugged\" attribute. All other\n  methods are not exported to the plugged-in class.\n\n* Method calls that are to be sent to the plugged-in class are put in the\n  init() method. Examples of these are set_sql(), add_trigger() and so on.\n\n* The class parameter for the init() method and the \"Plugged\" methods is the\n  plugged-in class, not the plugin class.\n",
