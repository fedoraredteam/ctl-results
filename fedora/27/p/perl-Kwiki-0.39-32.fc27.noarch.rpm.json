It is one of the most popular forms of web collaboration.\nIf you are new to wiki, visit http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors\nwhich is possibly the oldest wiki, and has lots of information about how\nwikis work.\n\nKwiki is a Perl wiki implementation based on the Spoon application\narchitecture and using the Spiffy object orientation model. The major goals\nof Kwiki are that it be easy to install, maintain and extend.\n\nAll the features of a Kwiki wiki come from plugin modules. The base\ninstallation comes with the bare minimum plugins to make a working Kwiki.\nTo make a really nice Kwiki installation you need to install additional\nplugins. Which plugins you pick is entirely up to you. Another goal of\nKwiki is that every installation will be unique. When there are hundreds of\nplugins available, this will hopefully be the case.\n",
