This\npackage helps you to organize and selectively import your own and the\nbuilt-in types in libraries. As a nice side effect, it catches typos at\ncompile-time too.\n\nHowever, the main reason for this module is to provide an easy way to not\nhave conflicts with your type names, since the internal fully qualified\nnames of the types will be prefixed with the library's name.\n\nThis module will also provide you with some helper functions to make it\neasier to use Moose types in your code.\n",
