            "Description": "\nIf you've ever tried to use Test::NoWarnings to confirm there are no warnings\ngenerated by your tests, combined with the convenience of done_testing to not\nhave to declare a test count, you'll have discovered that these two features do\nnot play well together, as the test count will be calculated before the\nwarnings test is run, resulting in a TAP error (see examples/test_nowarnings.pl\nin this distribution for a demonstration).\n\nThis module is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement for\nTest::NoWarnings: it also adds an extra test, but runs this test before\ndone_testing calculates the test count, rather than after. It does this by\nhooking into done_testing as well as via an END block. You can declare a plan,\nor not, and things will still Just Work.\n\nIt is actually equivalent to:\n\n    use Test::NoWarnings 1.04 ':early';\n\nas warnings are still printed normally as they occur. You are safe, and\nenthusiastically encouraged, to perform a global search-replace of the above\nwith use Test::Warnings; whether or not your tests have a plan.\n",
