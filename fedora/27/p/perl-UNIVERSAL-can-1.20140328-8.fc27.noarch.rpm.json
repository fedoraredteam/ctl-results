Object orientation allows programmers to override these\nmethods in subclasses to provide more specific and appropriate behavior.\n\nSome authors call methods in the UNIVERSAL class on potential invocants\nas functions, bypassing any possible overriding. This is wrong and you\nshould not do it. Unfortunately, not everyone heeds this warning and\ntheir bad code can break your good code.\n",
