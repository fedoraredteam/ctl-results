Specialized immutable versions may be added in the\n  future though.\n* Equality comparison between elements are always performed using the shallow\n  comparison operator (===).\n* Sorting algorithms are unstable, that means the order for equal elements is\n  undefined (the default, and only PHP behavior).\n\nAutoloader: /usr/share/php/PhpCollection/autoload.php\n",
