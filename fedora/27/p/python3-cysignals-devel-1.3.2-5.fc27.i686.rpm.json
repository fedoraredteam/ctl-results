            "Description": "\nWhen writing Cython code, special care must be taken to ensure that the\ncode can be interrupted with CTRL-C. Since Cython optimizes for speed,\nCython normally does not check for interrupts. For example, code like\nthe following cannot be interrupted in Cython:\n\nwhile True:\n    pass\n\nThe cysignals package provides mechanisms to handle interrupts\n(and other signals and errors) in Cython code.\n\nSee http://cysignals.readthedocs.org/ for the full documentation.\n",
