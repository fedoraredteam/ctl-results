Although they can all be used separately, the main functionality\nof each of the modules is best represented in the CGI::Ex::App module.\nCGI::Ex::App takes CGI application building to the next step. CGI::Ex::App\nis not quite a framework (which normally includes pre-built html) instead\nCGI::Ex::App is an extended application flow that dramatically reduces CGI\nbuild time in most cases. It does so using as little magic as possible. See\nCGI::Ex::App.\n",
