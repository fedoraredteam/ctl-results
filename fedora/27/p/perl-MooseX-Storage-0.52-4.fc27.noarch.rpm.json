This is still an early release\nof this module, so use with caution. It's outward facing serialization\nAPI should be considered stable, but I still reserve the right to make\ntweaks if I need too. Anything beyond the basic pack/unpack, freeze/thaw\nand load/store should not be relied on. There are 3 levels to the\nserialization, each of which builds upon the other and each of which\ncan be customized to the specific needs of your class.\n",
