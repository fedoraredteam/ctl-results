Specially-formatted 'smart' comments are replaced by\nexecutable code to dump variables to screen or to file, display loop progress\nbars, or enforce conditions. These smart comments can all be disabled at once\nby commenting out the \"use Devel::Comments\" line, whereupon they return to\nbeing simple, dumb comments. Your debugging code can remain in place,\nguaranteed harmless, ready for the next development cycle.\n",
