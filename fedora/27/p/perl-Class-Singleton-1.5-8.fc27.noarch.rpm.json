            "Description": "\nThis is the Class::Singleton module. A Singleton describes an object class\nthat can have only one instance in any system. An example of a Singleton\nmight be a print spooler or system registry. This module implements a\nSingleton class from which other classes can be derived. By itself, the\nClass::Singleton module does very little other than manage the\ninstantiation of a single object. In deriving a class from\nClass::Singleton, your module will inherit the Singleton instantiation\nmethod and can implement whatever specific functionality is required.\n",
