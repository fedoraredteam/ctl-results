Markdown's text format\nis most similar to that of plain text email, and supports features\nsuch as headers, *emphasis*, code blocks, blockquotes, and links.\n\nMarkdown's syntax is designed not as a generic markup language, but\nspecifically to serve as a front-end to (X)HTML. You can use\nspan-level HTML tags anywhere in a Markdown document, and you can use\nblock level HTML tags (like <div> and <table> as well).\n\nFor more information about Markdown's syntax, see:\n\n    http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n",
