            "Description": "\nThe peak.util.extremes module provides a production-quality implementation of\nthe Min and Max objects from PEP 326.  While PEP 326 was rejected for inclusion\nin the language or standard library, the objects described in it are useful in\na variety of applications.  In PEAK, they have been used to implement generic\nfunctions (in RuleDispatch and PEAK-Rules), as well as to handle scheduling and\ntime operations in the Trellis.  Because this has led to each project copying\nthe same code, we've now split the module out so it can be used independently.\n",
