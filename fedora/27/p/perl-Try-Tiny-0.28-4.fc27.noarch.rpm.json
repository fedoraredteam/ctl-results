            "Description": "\nThis module provides bare bones try/catch statements that are designed to\nminimize common mistakes with eval blocks, and NOTHING else.\n\nThis is unlike TryCatch, which provides a nice syntax and avoids adding\nanother call stack layer, and supports calling return from the try block to\nreturn from the parent subroutine. These extra features come at a cost of a\nfew dependencies, namely Devel::Declare and Scope::Upper that are occasionally\nproblematic, and the additional catch filtering uses Moose type constraints,\nwhich may not be desirable either.\n",
