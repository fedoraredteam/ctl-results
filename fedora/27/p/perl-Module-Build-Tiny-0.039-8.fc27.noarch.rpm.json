            "Description": "\nMany Perl distributions use a Build.PL file instead of a Makefile.PL file to\ndrive distribution configuration, build, test and installation. Traditionally,\nBuild.PL uses Module::Build as the underlying build system. This module\nprovides a simple, lightweight, drop-in replacement.\n\nWhereas Module::Build has over 6,700 lines of code; this module has less than\n70, yet supports the features needed by most pure-Perl distributions.\n",
