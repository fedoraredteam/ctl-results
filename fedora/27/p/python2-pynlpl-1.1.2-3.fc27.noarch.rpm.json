It contains various modules useful for common, and less common,\nNLP tasks. PyNLPl can be used for basic tasks such as the extraction of\nn-grams and frequency lists, and to build simple language model. There are\nalso more complex data types and algorithms. Moreover, there are parsers for\nfile formats common in NLP (e.g. FoLiA/Giza/Moses/ARPA/Timbl/CQL). There are\nalso clients to interface with various NLP specific servers. PyNLPl most\nnotably features a very extensive library for working with FoLiA XML (Format\nfor Linguistic Annotation).\n",
