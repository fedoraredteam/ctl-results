            "Description": "\nSmart comments provide an easy way to insert debugging and tracking code into\na program. They can report the value of a variable, track the progress of a\nloop, and verify that particular assertions are true.\n\nBest of all, when you're finished debugging, you don't have to remove them.\nSimply commenting out the use Smart::Comments line turns them back into\nregular comments. Leaving smart comments in your code is smart because if you\nneeded them once, you'll almost certainly need them again later.\n",
