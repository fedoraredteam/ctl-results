It has been extracted from the Requests project.\n\nPlease note that this Fedora package does not actually include a certificate\ncollection at all. It reads the system shared certificate trust collection\ninstead. For more details on this system, see the ca-certificates package.\n\nThis package provides the Python 2 certifi library.\n",
