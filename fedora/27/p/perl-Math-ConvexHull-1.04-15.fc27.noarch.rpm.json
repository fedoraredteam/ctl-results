It is a straightforward implementation of the\nalgorithm known as Graham's scan which, with complexity of O(n*log(n)), is\nthe fastest known method of finding the convex hull of an arbitrary set of\npoints. There are some methods of eliminating points that cannot be part of\nthe convex hull. These may or may not be implemented in a future version.\n",
