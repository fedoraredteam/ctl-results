With django-sekizai you can define placeholders\nwhere your blocks get rendered and at different places in your templates\nappend to those blocks. This is especially useful for css and javascript.\nYour sub-templates can now define css and Javascript files to be included,\nand the css will be nicely put at the top and the Javascript to the bottom,\njust like you should. Also sekizai will ignore any duplicate content\nin a single block.\n",
