            "Description": "\nThis libary can serve as an advanced lexer for (GNU) makefiles. It parses\nmakefiles as \"documents\" and the parsing is lossless. The results are data\nstructures similar to DOM trees. The DOM trees hold every single bit of the\ninformation in the original input files, including white spaces, blank\nlines and makefile comments. That means it's possible to reproduce the\noriginal makefiles from the DOM trees. In addition, each node of the DOM\ntrees is modifiable and so is the whole tree, just like the PPI module used\nfor Perl source parsing and the HTML::TreeBuilder module used for parsing\nHTML source.\n",
