            "Description": "\nRoles are composable units of behavior. They are useful for factoring out\nfunctionality common to many classes from any part of your class hierarchy.\n(See Moose::Cookbook::Roles::Recipe1 for an introduction to Moose::Role.)\n\nWhile combining roles affords you a great deal of flexibility, individual\nroles have very little in the way of configurability. Core Moose provides\nalias for renaming methods to avoid conflicts, and excludes for ignoring\nmethods you don't want or need (see Moose::Cookbook::Roles::Recipe2 for more\nabout alias and excludes).\n\nBecause roles serve many different masters, they usually provide only the\nleast common denominator of functionality. To empower roles further, more\nconfigurability than alias and excludes is required. Perhaps your role needs\nto know which method to call when it is done. Or what default value to use for\nits url attribute.\n\nParameterized roles offer exactly this solution.\n",
