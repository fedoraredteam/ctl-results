FIGlets use a\n  special font format, called FLT (FigLet Font). By default, one standard font\n  is shipped with Zend\\Text\\Figlet, but you can download additional fonts here\n\n* Zend\\Text\\Table to create text based tables on the fly with different\n  decorators. This can be helpful, if you either want to send structured data\n  in text emails, which are used to have mono-spaced fonts, or to display table\n  information in a CLI application. Zend\\Text\\Table supports multi-line columns,\n  colspan and align as well.\n",
