It also features\na publish/subscribe mechanism for notifying interested parties of window\nmanager events.\n\ni3ipc-python is a Python library for controlling the window manager. This\nproject is intended to be useful for general scripting, and for applications\nthat interact with the window manager like status line generators, notification\ndaemons, and pagers.\n",
