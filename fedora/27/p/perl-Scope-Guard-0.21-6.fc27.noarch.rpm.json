            "Description": "\nThis module provides a convenient way to perform cleanup or other forms of\nresource management at the end of a scope. It is particularly useful when\ndealing with exceptions: the Scope::Guard constructor takes a reference to\na subroutine that is guaranteed to be called even if the thread of\nexecution is aborted prematurely. This effectively allows lexically-scoped\n\"promises\" to be made that are automatically honored by perl's garbage\ncollector.\n",
