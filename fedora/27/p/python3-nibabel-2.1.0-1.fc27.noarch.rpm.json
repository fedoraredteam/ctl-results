We can read and write Freesurfer geometry, and read Freesurfer\nmorphometry and annotation files. There is some very limited support for DICOM.\nNiBabel is the successor of PyNIfTI.\n\nThe various image format classes give full or selective access to header (meta)\ninformation and access to the image data is made available via NumPy arrays.\n\nPython 3 version.\n",
