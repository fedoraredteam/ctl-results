            "Description": "\nTheano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and\nevaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays\nefficiently.  Theano features:\n- tight integration with NumPy: Use numpy.ndarray in Theano-compiled\n  functions.\n- transparent use of a GPU: Perform data-intensive calculations up to\n  140x faster than with CPU.(float32 only)\n- efficient symbolic differentiation: Theano does your derivatives for\n  function with one or many inputs.\n- speed and stability optimizations: Get the right answer for log(1+x)\n  even when x is really tiny.\n- dynamic C code generation: Evaluate expressions faster.\n- extensive unit-testing and self-verification: Detect and diagnose many\n  types of mistake.\n",
