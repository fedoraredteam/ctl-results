However, Pylint\noffers some more features, like checking length of lines of code,\nchecking if variable names are well-formed according to your coding\nstandard, or checking if declared interfaces are truly implemented,\nand much more.\nAdditionally, it is possible to write plugins to add your own checks.\n",
