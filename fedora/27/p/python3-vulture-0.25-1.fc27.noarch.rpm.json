If you run it\non both your library and test suite you can find untested code.\nDue to Python\u2019s dynamic nature, static code analyzers like vulture\nare likely to miss some dead code. Also, code that is only called\nimplicitly may be reported as unused. Nonetheless, vulture can be a\nvery helpful tool for higher code quality.\n",
