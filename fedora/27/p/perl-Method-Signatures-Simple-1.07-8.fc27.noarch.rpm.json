It's intentionally simple, and is supposed to be a\nstepping stone for its bigger brothers MooseX::Method::Signatures and\nMethod::Signatures.  It only has a small benefit over regular subs,\nso if you want more features, look at those modules.  But if you're\nlooking for a small amount of syntactic sugar, this might just be enough.\n",
