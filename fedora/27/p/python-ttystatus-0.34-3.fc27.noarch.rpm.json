Output\nis automatically adapted to the width of the terminal: truncated if it\ndoes not fit, and re-sized if the terminal size changes.\n\nOutput is provided via widgets. Each widgets formats some data into a\nsuitable form for output. It gets the data either via its initializer,\nor from key/value pairs maintained by the master object. The values\nare set by the user. Every time a value is updated, widgets get\nupdated (although the terminal is only updated every so often to give\nuser time to actually read the output).\n",
