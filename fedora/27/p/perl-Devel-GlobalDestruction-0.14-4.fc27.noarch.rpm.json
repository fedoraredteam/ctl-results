            "Description": "\nPerl's global destruction is a little tricky to deal with with respect to\nfinalizers because it's not ordered and objects can sometimes disappear.\n\nWriting defensive destructors is hard and annoying, and usually if global\ndestruction is happening you only need the destructors that free up non\nprocess local resources to actually execute.\n\nFor these constructors you can avoid the mess by simply bailing out if\nglobal destruction is in effect.\n",
