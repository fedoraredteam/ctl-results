            "Description": "\nThe rosdistro tool allows you to get access to the full dependency tree and\nthe version control system information of all packages and repositories. To\nincrease performance, the rosdistro tool will automatically look for a cache\nfile on your local disk. If no cache file is found locally, it will try to\ndownload the latest cache file from the server. The cache files are only used\nto improve performance, and are not needed to get correct results. rosdistro\nwill automatically go to Github to find any dependencies that are not part\nof the cache file. Note that operation without a cache file can be very slow,\ndepending on your own internet connection and the response times of Github.\nThe rosdistro tool will always write the latest dependency information to a\nlocal cache file, to speed up performance for the next query.\n",
