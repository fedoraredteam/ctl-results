Once both this project and\nthe CommonMark specification are stable we will release the first 1.0 version\nand attempt to keep up to date with changes in stmd.js.\n\nWe are currently at the same development stage (actually a bit ahead because we\nhave implemented HTML entity conversion and href URL escaping) as stmd.js. Since\nPython versions pre-3.4 use outdated (i.e. not HTML5 spec) entity conversion,\nI\u2019ve converted the 3.4 implementation into a single file, entitytrans.py which\nso far seems to work (all tests pass on 2.7, 3.3, and 3.4).\n",
