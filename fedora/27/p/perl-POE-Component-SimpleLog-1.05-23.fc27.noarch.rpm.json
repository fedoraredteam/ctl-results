Once that is done, any log messages your program\ngenerates ( sent to SimpleLog of course ) will be massaged, then sent to the\ntarget session / target event for processing.\n\nThis enables an interesting logging system that can be changed during runtime\nand allow pluggable interpretation of messages.\n",
