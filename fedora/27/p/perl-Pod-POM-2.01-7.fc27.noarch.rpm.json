            "Description": "\nThis module implements a parser to convert Pod documents into a simple\nobject model form known hereafter as the Pod Object Model.  The object\nmodel is generated as a hierarchical tree of nodes, each of which\nrepresents a different element of the original document.  The tree can\nbe walked manually and the nodes examined, printed or otherwise\nmanipulated.  In addition, Pod::POM supports and provides view objects\nwhich can automatically traverse the tree, or section thereof, and\ngenerate an output representation in one form or another.\n",
