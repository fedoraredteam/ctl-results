If Distlib can be made genuinely useful, then it is possible for\nthird-party packaging tools to transition to using it. Their developers and\nusers then benefit from standardised implementation of low-level functions,\ntime saved by not having to reinvent wheels, and improved interoperability\nbetween tools.\n",
