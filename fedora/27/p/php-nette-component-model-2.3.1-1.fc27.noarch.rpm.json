Components are wonderful.\nNette Framework introduces several classes and interfaces for all these\ntypes of components.\n\nObject inheritance allows us to have a hierarchic structure of classes like\nin real world. We can create new classes by extending. These extended classes\nare descendants of the original class and inherit its parameters and methods.\nExtended class can add its own parameters and methods to the inherited ones.\n\nTo use this library, you just have to add, in your project:\n  require_once '/usr/share/php/Nette/ComponentModel/autoload.php';\n",
