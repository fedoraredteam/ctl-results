The states that depend on the output of the\nqueries only get called when there is data for them to process.  No\nmore agonizing about query optimization in terms of milliseconds\nbecause the rest of your program will suffer.  Leave that to the\noperating system!  POE is designed for doing a lot of things\nconcurrently.  Waiting isn't doing, it's waiting... :-)\n",
