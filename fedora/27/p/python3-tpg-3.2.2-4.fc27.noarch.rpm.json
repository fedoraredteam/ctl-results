            "Description": "\nToy Parser Generator is a lexical and syntactic parser generator\nfor Python3. This generator was born from a simple statement: YACC\nis to complex to use in simple cases (calculators, configuration\nfiles, small programming languages, ...).\n\nTPG can very simply write parsers that are useful for most every\nday needs (even if it can't make your coffee). With a very clear\nand simple syntax, you can write an attributed grammar that is\ntranslated into a recursive descendant parser. TPG generated code\nis very closed to the original grammar. This means that the parser\nworks \"like\" the grammar. A grammar rule can be seen as a method\nof the parser class, symbols as method calls, attributes as method\nparameters and semantic values as return values. You can also add\nPython code directly into grammar rules and build abstract syntax\ntrees while parsing.\n",
