Underneath the hood it uses 'URI.pm', though\nbecause of the simplified interface it may not support all possible options\nfor all types of URIs.\n\nIt was created for the common case where you simply want to have a simple\ninterface for creating syntactically correct URIs from known components\n(like a path and query string). Doing this using the native 'URI.pm'\ninterface is rather tedious, requiring a number of method calls, which is\nparticularly ugly when done inside a templating system such as Mason or\nTT2.\n",
