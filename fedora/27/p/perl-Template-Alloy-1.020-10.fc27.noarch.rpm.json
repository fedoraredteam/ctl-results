With Template::Alloy you can use your\nfavorite template interface and syntax and get features from each of the other\nmajor template systems.  And Template::Alloy is fast - whether you're using\nmod_perl, CGI, or running from the command line.  There is even\nTemplate::Alloy::XS for getting a little more speed when that is necessary.\n",
