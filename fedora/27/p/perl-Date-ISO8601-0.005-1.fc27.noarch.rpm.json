It also defines\ntextual formats for the representation of dates in these calendars. This\nmodule provides functions to convert dates between these three calendars\nand Chronological Julian Day Numbers, which is a suitable format to do\narithmetic with. It also supplies functions that describe the shape of\nthese calendars, to assist in calendrical calculations. It also supplies\nfunctions to represent dates textually in the ISO 8601 formats. ISO 8601\nalso covers time of day and time periods, but this module does nothing\nrelating to those parts of the standard; this is only about labeling days.\n",
