            "Description": "\nParser combinators are just higher-order functions that take parsers as their\narguments and return them as result values. Parser combinators are:\n* First-class values\n* Extremely composable\n* Tend to make the code quite compact\n* Resemble the readable notation of xBNF grammars\n\nParsers made with funcparserlib are pure-Python LL(*) parsers. It means that\nit's very easy to write them without thinking about look-aheads and all that\nhardcore parsing stuff. But the recursive descent parsing is a rather slow\nmethod compared to LL(k) or LR(k) algorithms.\n\nSo the primary domain for funcparserlib is parsing little languages or external\nDSLs (domain specific languages).\n",
