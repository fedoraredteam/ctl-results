            "Description": "\nThe QWizard module allows script authors to concentrate on the\ncontent of the forms they want their users to fill in without\nworrying about the display.  It allows \"Question Wizard\" like\ninterfaces to be very easily created and the results of the input\neasily acted upon.  Scripts written which are entirely based on\nQWizard inputs are able to be run from the command line which will\nshow a Gtk2, Tk window or as a ReadLine interactive session or as a\nCGI script without modification.  Script writers do not need to know\nwhich interface is being used to display the resulting form(s) as it\nshould be transparent to the script itself.\n\nOther wizard interfaces exist for perl, but this one strives very\nhard to be both extensible and easy to code with requiring as little\nwork by script authors as possible.  It is also one of the only ones\nthat supports both web environments and windowing environments\nwithout code modification required by the script author.\n",
