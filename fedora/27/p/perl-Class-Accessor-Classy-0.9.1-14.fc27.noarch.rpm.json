            "Description": "\nThe Class::Accessor::Classy Perl module provides an extremely small\nfootprint accessor/mutator declaration scheme for fast and convenient\nobject attribute setup.  It is intended as a simple and speedy mechanism\nfor preventing hash-key typos rather than a full-blown object system\nwith type checking and so on.\n\nThe accessor methods appear as a hidden parent class of your package\nand generally try to stay out of the way.  The accessors and mutators\ngenerated are of the form C<foo()> and C<set_foo()>, respectively.\n",
