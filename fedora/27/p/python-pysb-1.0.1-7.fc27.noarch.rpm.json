            "Description": "\nPySB is a framework for building mathematical models of biochemical\nsystems as Python programs. PySB abstracts the complex process of\ncreating equations describing interactions among multiple proteins or\nother biomolecules into a simple and intuitive domain specific\nprogramming language, which is internally translated into BioNetGen or\nKappa rules and from there into systems of equations. PySB makes it\nstraightforward to divide models into modules and to call libraries of\nreusable elements (macros) that encode standard biochemical\nactions. These features promote model transparency, reuse and\naccuracy. PySB also interoperates with standard scientific Python\nlibraries such as NumPy, SciPy and SymPy enabling model simulation and\nanalysis.\n",
