This is mainly a dependency of my other software packages, and is\nprobably of little interest to you unless you use those. If you're curious\nnonetheless, here's what's on offer:\n\n  * A ton of small tool functions such as `len_iterable`, `argmin`,\n    tuple generation, permutation generation, ASCII table pretty printing,\n    GvR's mokeypatch_xxx() hack, the elusive `flatten`, and much more.\n  * Michele Simionato's decorator module\n  * A time-series logging module, `pytools.log`.\n  * Batch job submission, `pytools.batchjob`.\n  * A lexer, `pytools.lex`.\n\nPython 2 version.\n",
