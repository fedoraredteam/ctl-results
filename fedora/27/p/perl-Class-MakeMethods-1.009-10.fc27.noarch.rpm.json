            "Description": "\nThe Class::MakeMethods framework allows Perl class developers to quickly\ndefine common types of methods. When a module uses Class::MakeMethods or one\nof its subclasses, it can select from a variety of supported method types, and\nspecify a name for each method desired. The methods are dynamically generated\nand installed in the calling package.\n\nConstruction of the individual methods is handled by subclasses. This\ndelegation approach allows for a wide variety of method-generation techniques\nto be supported, each by a different subclass. Subclasses can also be added to\nprovide support for new types of methods.\n\nOver a dozen subclasses are available, including implementations of a variety\nof different method-generation techniques. Each subclass generates several\ntypes of methods, with some supporting their own open-eneded extension syntax,\nfor hundreds of possible combinations of method types.\n",
