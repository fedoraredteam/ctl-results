That's because of all\nthe internal exceptions that are being thrown and caught by Catalyst during\napplication startup. You'd have to manually skip over all of those.\n\nThis role works around that by automatically setting up Carp::REPL after\nstarting your application, if the CATALYST_REPL or MYAPP_REPL environment\nvariables are set.\n",
