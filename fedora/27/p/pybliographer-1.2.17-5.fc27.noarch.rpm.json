It can be\nused for searching, editing, reformatting, etc. In fact, it's a simple\nframework that provides easy to use python classes and functions, and\ntherefore can be extended to many uses (generating HTML pages according\nto bibliographic searches, etc).\nIn addition to the scripting environment, a graphical Gnome interface\nis available. It provides powerful editing capabilities, a nice\nhierarchical search mechanism, direct insertion of references into LyX,\ndirect queries on Medline, and more. It currently supports the following\nfile formats: BibTeX, ISI, Medline, Ovid, Refer.\n",
