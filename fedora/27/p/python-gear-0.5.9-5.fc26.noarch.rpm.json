            "Description": "\npython-gear implements an asynchronous event-driven interface to Gearman.\nIt provides interfaces to build a client or worker, and access to the\nadministrative protocol. The design approach is to keep it simple, with a\nrelatively thin abstraction of the Gearman protocol itself. It should be\neasy to use to build a client or worker that operates either synchronously\nor asynchronously. The module also provides a simple Gearman server for\nuse as a convenience in unit tests. The server is not designed for\nproduction use under load.\n",
