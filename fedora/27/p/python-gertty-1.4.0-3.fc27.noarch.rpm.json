            "Description": "\nGertty is a console-based interface to the Gerrit Code Review system. As\ncompared to the web interface, the main advantages are: (a) Work flow -- the\ninterface is designed to support a work flow similar to reading network news or\nmail. In particular, it is designed to deal with a large number of review\nrequests across a large number of projects. (b) Offline Use -- Gertty syncs\ninformation about changes in subscribed projects to a local database and local\ngit repositories. All review operations are performed against that database\nand then synced back to Gerrit. (c) Speed -- user actions modify locally\ncached content and need not wait for server interaction. (d) Convenience --\nbecause Gertty downloads all changes to local git repositories, a single\ncommand instructs it to checkout a change into that repositories for detailed\nexamination or testing of larger changes.\n",
