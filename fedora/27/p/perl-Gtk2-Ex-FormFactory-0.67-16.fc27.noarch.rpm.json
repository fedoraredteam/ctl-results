Instead you declare the structure of your GUI, connect it to the data of\nyour program (which should be a well defined set of objects) and control how\nthis structure is transformed into a specific layout in a very generic way.\n\nAutomatically keep widget and object states in synchronization (in both\ndirections), even with complex data structures with a lot of internal\ndependencies, object nesting etc.\n",
