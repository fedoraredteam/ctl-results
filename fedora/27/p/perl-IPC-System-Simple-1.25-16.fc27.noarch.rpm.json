            "Description": "\nCalling Perl's in-built 'system()' function is easy; determining if it\nwas successful is _hard_. Let's face it, '$?' isn't the nicest variable\nin the world to play with, and even if you _do_ check it, producing a\nwell-formatted error string takes a lot of work. 'IPC::System::Simple'\ntakes the hard work out of calling external commands. In fact, if you\nwant to be really lazy, you can just write:\n\n    use IPC::System::Simple qw(system);\n\nand all of your \"system\" commands will either succeed (run to completion and\nreturn a zero exit value), or die with rich diagnostic messages.\n",
