Normally, the kittens would be helpless, but\nif they use UNIVERSAL::isa (the module whose docs you are reading),\nthe kittens can live long and prosper.\n\nThis module replaces UNIVERSAL::isa with a version that makes sure\nthat if it's called as a function on objects which override isa,\nisa will be called on those objects as a method.\n\nIn all other cases the real UNIVERSAL::isa is just called directly.\n",
