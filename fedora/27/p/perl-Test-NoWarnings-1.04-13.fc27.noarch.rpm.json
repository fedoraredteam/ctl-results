It automatically adds an extra test\nthat will run when your script ends to check that there were no warnings.\nIf there were any warnings, the test will give a \"not ok\" and diagnostics of\nwhere, when and what the warning was, including a stack trace of what was\ngoing on when the it occurred.\n",
