            "Description": "\n\nPDFMiner is a tool for extracting information from PDF documents.\nUnlike other PDF-related tools, it focuses entirely on getting and\nanalyzing text data. PDFMiner allows to obtain the exact location\nof texts in a page, as well as other information such as fonts or\nlines. It includes a PDF converter that can transform PDF files\ninto other text formats (such as HTML). It has an extensible PDF\nparser that can be used for other purposes instead of text analysis.\n\nThis is actually pdfminer.six, a backwards-compatible fork of\nPDFMiner using six for Python 2+3 compatibility.\n",
