            "Description": "\nThe Token Key Service (TKS) is an optional PKI subsystem that manages the\nmaster key(s) and the transport key(s) required to generate and distribute\nkeys for hardware tokens.  TKS provides the security between tokens and an\ninstance of Token Processing System (TPS), where the security relies upon the\nrelationship between the master key and the token keys.  A TPS communicates\nwith a TKS over SSL using client authentication.\n\nTKS helps establish a secure channel (signed and encrypted) between the token\nand the TPS, provides proof of presence of the security token during\nenrollment, and supports key changeover when the master key changes on the\nTKS.  Tokens with older keys will get new token keys.\n\nBecause of the sensitivity of the data that TKS manages, TKS should be set up\nbehind the firewall with restricted access.\n\nThis package is one of the top-level java-based Tomcat PKI subsystems\nprovided by the PKI Core used by the Certificate System.\n\n\n==================================\n||  ABOUT \"CERTIFICATE SYSTEM\"  ||\n==================================\n\nCertificate System (CS) is an enterprise software system designed\nto manage enterprise Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) deployments.\n\nPKI Core contains ALL top-level java-based Tomcat PKI components:\n\n  * pki-symkey\n  * pki-base\n  * pki-base-python2 (alias for pki-base)\n  * pki-base-python3\n  * pki-base-java\n  * pki-tools\n  * pki-server\n  * pki-ca\n  * pki-kra\n  * pki-ocsp\n  * pki-tks\n  * pki-tps\n  * pki-javadoc\n\nwhich comprise the following corresponding PKI subsystems:\n\n  * Certificate Authority (CA)\n  * Key Recovery Authority (KRA)\n  * Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Manager\n  * Token Key Service (TKS)\n  * Token Processing Service (TPS)\n\nPython clients need only install the pki-base package.  This\npackage contains the python REST client packages and the client\nupgrade framework.\n\nJava clients should install the pki-base-java package.  This package\ncontains the legacy and REST Java client packages.  These clients\nshould also consider installing the pki-tools package, which contain\nnative and Java-based PKI tools and utilities.\n\nCertificate Server instances require the fundamental classes and\nmodules in pki-base and pki-base-java, as well as the utilities in\npki-tools.  The main server classes are in pki-server, with subsystem\nspecific Java classes and resources in pki-ca, pki-kra, pki-ocsp etc.\n\nFinally, if Certificate System is being deployed as an individual or\nset of standalone rather than embedded server(s)/service(s), it is\nstrongly recommended (though not explicitly required) to include at\nleast one PKI Theme package:\n\n  * dogtag-pki-theme (Dogtag Certificate System deployments)\n    * dogtag-pki-server-theme\n  * redhat-pki-server-theme (Red Hat Certificate System deployments)\n    * redhat-pki-server-theme\n  * customized pki theme (Customized Certificate System deployments)\n    * <customized>-pki-server-theme\n\n  NOTE:  As a convenience for standalone deployments, top-level meta\n         packages may be provided which bind a particular theme to\n         these certificate server packages.\n",
