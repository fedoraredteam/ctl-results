Perl is good at handling processes and files, and is especially\ngood at handling text. Perl's hallmarks are practicality and efficiency.\nWhile it is used to do a lot of different things, Perl's most common\napplications are system administration utilities and web programming.\n\nThis is a metapackage with all the Perl bits and core modules that can be\nfound in the upstream tarball from perl.org.\n\nIf you need only a specific feature, you can install a specific package\ninstead. E.g. to handle Perl scripts with /usr/bin/perl interpreter,\ninstall perl-interpreter package. See perl-interpreter description for more\ndetails on the Perl decomposition into packages.\n",
