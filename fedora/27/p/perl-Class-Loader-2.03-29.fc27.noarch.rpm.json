            "Description": "\nCertain applications like to defer the decision to use a particular module till\nruntime. This is possible in perl, and is a useful trick in situations where\nthe type of data is not known at compile time and the application doesn't wish\nto pre-compile modules to handle all types of data it can work with. Loading\nmodules at runtime can also provide flexible interfaces for perl modules.\nModules can let the programmer decide what modules will be used by it instead\nof hard-coding their names.\n\nClass::Loader is an inheritable class that provides a method, _load(), to load\na module from disk and construct an object by calling its constructor. It also\nprovides a way to map modules' names and associated metadata with symbolic\nnames that can be used in place of module names at _load().\n",
