            "Description": "\nDogpile consists of two subsystems, one building on top of the other.\n\ndogpile provides the concept of a \"dogpile lock\", a control structure\nwhich allows a single thread of execution to be selected as the\n\"creator\" of some resource, while allowing other threads of execution to\nrefer to the previous version of this resource as the creation proceeds;\nif there is no previous version, then those threads block until the\nobject is available.\n\ndogpile.cache is a caching API which provides a generic interface to\ncaching backends of any variety, and additionally provides API hooks\nwhich integrate these cache backends with the locking mechanism of\ndogpile.\n\nOverall, dogpile.cache is intended as a replacement to the Beaker\ncaching system, the internals of which are written by the same author.\nAll the ideas of Beaker which \"work\" are re- implemented in\ndogpile.cache in a more efficient and succinct manner, and all the cruft\n(Beaker's internals were first written in 2005) relegated to the trash\nheap.\n",
