The version information for the distribution being\ntested is taken out of the Build data, or if that is not found, out of the\nMakefile. It then attempts to open, in order, a file with the name Changes or\nCHANGES. The Changes file is then parsed for version numbers. If one and only\none of the version numbers matches, the test passes; otherwise the test fails.\nA message with the current version is printed if the test passes; otherwise\ndiagnostic messages are printed to help explain the failure.\n",
