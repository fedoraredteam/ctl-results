File::KeePass attempts to\niron out as many of the differences.\n\nFile::KeePass gives nearly raw data access. There are a few\n utility methods for manipulating groups and entries. More\nadvanced manipulation can easily be layered on top by\nother modules.\n\nFile::KeePass is only used for reading and writing databases\nand for keeping passwords scrambled while in memory.\nPrograms dealing with UI or using of auto-type features are\nthe domain of other modules on CPAN. File::KeePass::Agent\nis one example.\n",
