            "Description": "\nPuddletag is an audio tag editor.\n\nUnlike most taggers, it uses a spreadsheet-like layout so that all the\ntags you want to edit by hand are visible and easily editable.\n\nThe usual tag editor features are supported like extracting tag\ninformation from filenames, renaming files based on their tags by\nusing patterns (that you define, not crappy, uneditable ones).\n\nThen there are Functions, which can do things like replace text, trim,\nchange the case of tags, etc. Actions can automate repetitive\ntasks. You can import your QuodLibet library, lookup tags using\nAcoustID, MusicBrainz, FreeDB or Amazon (though it is only good for\ncover art) and more.\n\nSupported formats: ID3v1, ID3v2 (mp3), MP4 (mp4, m4a, etc.),\nVorbisComments (ogg, flac), Musepack (mpc), Monkeys Audio (.ape) and\nWavPack (wv).\n",
