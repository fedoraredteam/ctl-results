            "Description": "\nThis is an XML parser based on PHPs built-in xml extension.\nIt supports two basic modes of operation: \"func\" and \"event\".\nIn \"func\" mode, it will look for a function named after each element\n(xmltag_ELEMENT for start tags and xmltag_ELEMENT_ for end tags),\nand in \"event\" mode it uses a set of generic callbacks.\n\nSince version 1.2.0 there's a new XML_Parser_Simple class that makes\nparsing of most XML documents easier, by automatically providing a stack\nfor the elements. Furthermore its now possible to split the parser from\nthe handler object, so you do not have to extend XML_Parser anymore in\norder to parse a document with it.\n",
