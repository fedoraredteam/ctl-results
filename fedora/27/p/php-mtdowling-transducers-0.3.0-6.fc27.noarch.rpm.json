            "Description": "\nTransducers [1] are composable algorithmic transformations. They are independent\nfrom the context of their input and output sources and specify only the essence\nof the transformation in terms of an individual element. Because transducers are\ndecoupled from input or output sources, they can be used in many different\nprocesses - collections, streams, channels, observables, etc. Transducers\ncompose directly, without awareness of input or creation of intermediate\naggregates.\n\n[1] http://clojure.org/transducers\n",
