There are several problems with this approach:\n\nWhat if the resource is on a very slow server?  Do we wait forever or what?\nWhat if the resource is a 900 gig file?  You don't want to download that.\nWhat if the page title isn't in a title tag, but is buried in the HTML\nsomewhere?\nWhat if the resource is an MP3 file, or a word document or something?\n...\n\nSo, let's solve these issues once.\n",
