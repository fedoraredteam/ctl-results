            "Description": "\npeak.util.assembler is a simple bytecode assembler module that handles most\nlow-level bytecode generation details like jump offsets, stack size tracking,\nline number table generation, constant and variable name index tracking, etc.\nThat way, you can focus your attention on the desired semantics of your\nbytecode instead of on these mechanical issues.\n\nIn addition to a low-level opcode-oriented API for directly generating specific\nPython bytecodes, this module also offers an extensible mini-AST framework for\ngenerating code from high-level specifications.  This framework does most of\nthe work needed to transform tree-like structures into linear bytecode\ninstructions, and includes the ability to do compile-time constant folding.\n",
