            "Description": "\nThis module provides a shared memory cache accessed as a tied hash.\nShared memory is an area of memory that is available to all processes.\nIt is accessed by choosing a key, the ipc_key argument to tie.  Every\nprocess that accesses shared memory with the same key gets access to\nthe same region of memory.  In some ways it resembles a file system,\nbut it is not hierarchical and it is resident in memory.  This makes\nit harder to use than a filesystem but much faster.  The data in\nshared memory persists until the machine is rebooted or it is\nexplicitly deleted.\n",
