MCE spawns a pool of workers and therefore\ndoes not fork a new process per each element of data. Instead, MCE follows\na bank queuing model. Imagine the line being the data and bank-tellers the\nparallel workers. MCE enhances that model by adding the ability to chunk\nthe next n elements from the input stream to the next available worker.\n",
