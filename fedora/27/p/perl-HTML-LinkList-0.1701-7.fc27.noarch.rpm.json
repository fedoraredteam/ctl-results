            "Description": "\nThis module contains a number of functions for taking sets of URLs and\nlabels and creating suitably formatted HTML. These links are \"smart\"\nbecause, if given the url of the current page, if any of the links in\nthe list equal it, that item in the list will be formatted as a special\nlabel, not as a link; this is a Good Thing, since the user would be\nconfused by clicking on a link back to the current page. While many\nwebsite systems have plugins for \"smart\" navbars, they are specialized\nfor that system only, and can't be reused elsewhere, forcing people to\nreinvent the wheel. I hereby present one wheel, free to be reused by\nanybody; just the simple functions, a backend, which can be plugged into\nwhatever system you want.The default format for the HTML is to make an\nunordered list, but there are many options, enabling one to have a\nflatter layout with any separators you desire, or a more complicated\nlist with differing formats for different levels.\n",
