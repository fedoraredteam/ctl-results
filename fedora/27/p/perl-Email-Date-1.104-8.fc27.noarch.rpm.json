            "Description": "\nRFC 2822 defines the \"Date:\" header. It declares the header a required\npart of an email message. The syntax for date headers is clearly laid\nout. Stil, even a perfectly planned world has storms. The truth is, many\nprograms get it wrong. Very wrong. Or, they don't include a \"Date:\"\nheader at all. This often forces you to look elsewhere for the date, and\nhoping to find something.\n\nFor this reason, the tedious process of looking for a valid date has\nbeen encapsulated in this software. Further, the process of creating RFC\ncompliant date strings is also found in this software.\n",
