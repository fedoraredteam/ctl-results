The\ngoal of the project is to make things as simple and easy as possible for both\ndevelopers and users of Alien modules.\n\nAlien is a Perl name space for defining dependencies in CPAN for libraries and\ntools which are not \"native\" to CPAN. Alien modules will typically use the\nsystem libraries if they are available, or download the latest version from\nthe internet and build them from source code. These libraries can then be\nused by other Perl modules, usually modules that are implemented with XS or FFI.\n",
