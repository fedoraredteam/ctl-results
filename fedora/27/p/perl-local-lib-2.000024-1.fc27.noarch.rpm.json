            "Description": "\nThis module provides a quick, convenient way of bootstrapping a user-\nlocal Perl module library located within the user's home directory. It\nalso constructs and prints out for the user the list of environment\nvariables using the syntax appropriate for the user's current shell (as\nspecified by the 'SHELL' environment variable), suitable for directly\nadding to one's shell configuration file.\n\nMore generally, local::lib allows for the bootstrapping and usage of a\ndirectory containing Perl modules outside of Perl's '@INC'. This makes\nit easier to ship an application with an app-specific copy of a Perl module,\nor collection of modules. Useful in cases like when an upstream maintainer\nhasn't applied a patch to a module of theirs that you need for your\napplication.\n",
