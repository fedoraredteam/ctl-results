It\nwill find cloud config for as few as 1 cloud and as many as you want to\nput in a config file. It will read environment variables and config files,\nand it also contains some vendor specific default values so that you don't\nhave to know extra info to use OpenStack\n\n* If you have a config file, you will get the clouds listed in it\n* If you have environment variables, you will get a cloud named `envvars`\n* If you have neither, you will get a cloud named `defaults` with base defaults\n",
