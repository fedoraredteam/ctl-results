            "Description": "\nDateTime::Set is a module for datetime sets. It can be used to handle two\ndifferent types of sets. The first is a fixed set of predefined datetime\nobjects. For example, if we wanted to create a set of datetimes containing\nthe birthdays of people in our family. The second type of set that it can\nhandle is one based on the idea of a recurrence, such as \"every Wednesday\",\nor \"noon on the 15th day of every month\". This type of set can have fixed\nstarting and ending datetimes, but neither is required. So our \"every\nWednesday set\" could be \"every Wednesday from the beginning of time until\nthe end of time\", or \"every Wednesday after 2003-03-05 until the end of\ntime\", or \"every Wednesday between 2003-03-05 and 2004-01-07\".\n",
