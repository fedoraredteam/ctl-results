True multi-level\nhash/array support (unlike MLDBM, which is faked), hybrid OO / tie()\ninterface, cross-platform FTPable files, and quite fast. Can handle\nmillions of keys and unlimited hash levels without significant slow-down.\nWritten from the ground-up in pure perl - this is NOT a wrapper around a\nC-based DBM. Out-of-the-box compatibility with Unix, Mac OS X and Windows.\n",
