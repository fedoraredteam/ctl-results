At this very early stage, the parser\nonly supports a limited set of features, so it may not recognize most of\nthe advanced features provided by certain make tools like GNU make. Its\ninitial purpose is to provide basic support for another module named\nMakefile::GraphViz, which is aimed to render the building process specified\nby a Makefile using the amazing GraphViz library. The Make module is not\nsatisfactory for this purpose, so I decided to build one of my own.\n",
