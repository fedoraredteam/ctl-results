            "Description": "\nPerl::Critic is an extensible framework for creating and applying coding\nstandards to Perl source code. Essentially, it is a static source code\nanalysis engine. Perl::Critic is distributed with a number of\nPerl::Critic::Policy modules that attempt to enforce various coding\nguidelines. Most Policy modules are based on Damian Conway's book Perl\nBest Practices. However, Perl::Critic is not limited to PBP and will\neven support Policies that contradict Conway. You can enable, disable,\nand customize those Polices through the Perl::Critic interface. You can\nalso create new Policy modules that suit your own tastes.\n",
