When a request\nfor delivery of a mail is received by Postfix via SMTP, the triplet CLIENT_IP /\nSENDER / RECIPIENT is built. If it is the first time that this triplet is\nseen, or if the triplet was first seen less than 5 minutes, then the mail gets\nrejected with a temporary error. Hopefully spammers or viruses will not try\nagain later, as it is however required per RFC.\n",
