The native types can\neasily be converted to JSON or any other format needed.\n\nThe goal of serpy is to be able to do this simply, reliably, and quickly.\nSince serializers are class based, they can be combined, extended and\ncustomized with very little code duplication. Compared to other popular\nPython serialization frameworks like marshmallow or Django Rest Framework\nSerializers serpy is at least an order of magnitude faster.\n\nPython 3 version.\n",
