Projects that do\nnot current use characteristic are not advised to adopt it: instead look at\nthe successor project, attrs (available as python2-attrs / python3-attrs).\n\nSay 'yes' to types but 'no' to typing!\n\ncharacteristic is a Python package with class decorators that ease the chores\nof implementing the most common attribute-related object protocols.\n\nYou just specify the attributes to work with and ``characteristic`` gives you:\n\n- a nice human-readable ``__repr__``,\n- a complete set of comparison methods,\n- and a kwargs-based initializer (that cooperates with your existing one)\n\n*without* writing dull boilerplate code again and again.\n\nSo put down that type-less data structures and welcome some class into your\nlife!\n",
