See the tutorial for examples. Quantities builds\non the popular numpy library and is designed to work with numpy ufuncs, many of\nwhich are already supported. Quantities is actively developed, and while the\ncurrent features and API are stable, test coverage is incomplete so the package\nis not suggested for mission-critical applications.\n",
