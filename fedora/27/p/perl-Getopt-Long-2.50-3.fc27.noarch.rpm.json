            "Description": "\nThe Getopt::Long module implements an extended getopt function called\nGetOptions(). It parses the command line from @ARGV, recognizing and removing\nspecified options and their possible values.  It adheres to the POSIX syntax\nfor command line options, with GNU extensions. In general, this means that\noptions have long names instead of single letters, and are introduced with\na double dash \"--\". Support for bundling of command line options, as was the\ncase with the more traditional single-letter approach, is provided but not\nenabled by default.\n",
