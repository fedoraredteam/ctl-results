It was simple\nenough to get started without knowing much about the language and powerful\nenough to keep you going, learning by doing was much fun. While most of the\ntechniques used are outdated now, the idea behind it is not. Mojolicious is\na new attempt at implementing this idea using state of the art technology.\n",
