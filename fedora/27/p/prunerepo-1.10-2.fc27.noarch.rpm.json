If there is a source rpm for a deleted rpm\n(and they both share the same directory path), then the source rpm\nwill be deleted as well.\n\nSupport for specific repository structure (e.g. COPR) is also available\nmaking it possible to additionally remove build logs and whole build\ndirectories associated with a package.\n\nAfter deletion of obsoleted packages, the command\n\"createrepo_c --database --update\" is called\nto recreate the repository metadata.\n",
