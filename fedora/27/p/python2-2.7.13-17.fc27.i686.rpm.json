The language is mostly the same, but many details, especially\nhow built-in objects like dictionaries and strings work, have changed\nconsiderably, and a lot of deprecated features have finally been removed in the\n3.x line.\n\nNote that documentation for Python 2 is provided in the python2-docs\npackage.\n\nThis package provides the \"python2\" executable; most of the actual\nimplementation is within the \"python2-libs\" package.\n",
