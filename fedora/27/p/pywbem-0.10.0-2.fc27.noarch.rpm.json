            "Description": "\nA Python library for making CIM (Common Information Model) operations over HTTP\nusing the WBEM CIM-XML protocol. It is based on the idea that a good WBEM\nclient should be easy to use and not necessarily require a large amount of\nprogramming knowledge. It is suitable for a large range of tasks from simply\npoking around to writing web and GUI applications.\n\nWBEM, or Web Based Enterprise Management is a manageability protocol, like\nSNMP, standardized by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) available\nat http://www.dmtf.org/standards/wbem.\n\nIt also provides a Python provider interface, and is the fastest and\neasiest way to write providers on the planet.\n",
