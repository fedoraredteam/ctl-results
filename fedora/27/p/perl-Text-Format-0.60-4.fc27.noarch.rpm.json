Text::Wrap will die under these\ncircumstances, although I am told this is fixed. If columns is set to a small\nnumber and words are longer than that and the leading 'whitespace' than there\nwill be a single word on each line. This will let you make a simple word list\nwhich could be indented or right aligned. There is a chance for croaking if you\ntry to subvert the module. If you don't pass in text then the internal text is\nworked on, though not modified. Text::Format is meant for more powerful text\nformatting than Text::Wrap allows.\n",
