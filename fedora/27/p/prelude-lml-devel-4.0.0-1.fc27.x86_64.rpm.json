It can act as a centralized log\ncollector for local or remote systems, or as a simple log analyzer (such as\nswatch). It can run as a network server listening on a syslog port or analyze\nlog files. It supports log files in the BSD syslog format and is able to analyze\nany log file by using the PCRE library. It can apply log file specific analysis\nthrough plugins such as PAX. It can send an alert to the Prelude Manager when a\nsuspicious log entry is detected.\n",
