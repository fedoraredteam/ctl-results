It was created to fill the gap between fetching\nrows from a database and transforming them into a web browser renderable\ntable. DBIx::XHTML_Table is intended for programmers who want the\nresponsibility of presenting (decorating) data, easily. This module is\nmeant to be used in situations where the concern for presentation and logic\nseparation is overkill. Providing logic or editable data is beyond the\nscope of this module, but it is capable of doing such.\n",
