They both take references to two arrays containing the x and y\nordinates of the data and return an array of the 1st or 2nd derivative at\nthe given x ordinates. Derivative2 may optionally be given values to use\nfor the first derivative at the start and end points of the data -\notherwise 'natural' values are used.\n",
