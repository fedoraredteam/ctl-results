In particular, it defines a standard string representation\n(so that credentials can be given to external programs as command line\noptions), a standard structured representation (so that credentials can\nbe stored in structured configuration files or using JSON) and\n\"preparators\" that can transform credentials into ready-to-use data for\nwell known targets.\n\nThe python module auth.credential is compatible with the Perl\nmodule Authen::Credential.\n",
