            "Description": "\nDist::Zilla builds distributions of code to be uploaded to the CPAN. In\nthis respect, it is like ExtUtils::MakeMaker, Module::Build, or\nModule::Install. Unlike those tools, however, it is not also a system for\ninstalling code that has been downloaded from the CPAN. Since it's only run\nby authors, and is meant to be run on a repository checkout rather than on\npublished, released code, it can do much more than those tools, and is free\nto make much more ludicrous demands in terms of prerequisites.\n",
