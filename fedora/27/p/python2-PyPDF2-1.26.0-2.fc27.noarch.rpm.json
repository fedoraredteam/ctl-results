            "Description": "\nA pure Python library built as a PDF toolkit.  It is capable of:\n\n- extracting document information (title, author, ...),\n- splitting documents page by page,\n- merging documents page by page,\n- cropping pages,\n- merging multiple pages into a single page,\n- encryption and decryption of PDF files.\n\nBy being pure Python, it should run on any Python platform without any\ndependencies on external libraries.  It can also work entirely on StringIO\nobjects rather than file streams, allowing for PDF manipulation in memory.\nIt is therefore a useful tool for websites that manage or manipulate PDFs.\n",
