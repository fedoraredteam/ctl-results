CPAN has already had Test::Kwalitee for the test module of\nKwalitee. It is, however, impossible to calculate prereq_matches_use indicator,\nbecause dependent module Module::CPANTS::Analyse itself cannot calculate\nprereq_matches_use indicator. It is marked as needs_db, but only limited\ninformation is needed to calculate the indicator. This module calculates\nprereq_matches_use by querying needed information from MetaCPAN.\n",
