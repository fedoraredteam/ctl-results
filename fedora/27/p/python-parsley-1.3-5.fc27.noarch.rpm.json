            "Description": "\nA parser generator library based on OMeta, and other useful parsing tools.\nParsley is a parsing library for people who find parsers scary or\nannoying. I wrote it because I wanted to parse a programming language,\nand tools like PLY or ANTLR or Bison were very hard to understand and\nintegrate into my Python code. Most parser generators are based on LL\nor LR parsing algorithms that compile to big state machine\ntables. It was like I had to wake up a different section of my brain\nto understand or work on grammar rules.\n\nParsley, like pyparsing and ZestyParser, uses the PEG algorithm, so\neach expression in the grammar rules works like a Python\nexpression. In particular, alternatives are evaluated in order, unlike\ntable-driven parsers such as yacc, bison or PLY.\n\nParsley is an implementation of OMeta, an object-oriented\npattern-matching language developed by Alessandro Warth at\nthesis, which provides a detailed description of OMeta:\nhttp://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2008003_experimenting.pdf\n",
