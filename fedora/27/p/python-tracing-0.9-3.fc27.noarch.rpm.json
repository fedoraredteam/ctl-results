            "Description": "\nThe Python library tracing helps with logging debug messages. It\nprovides a couple of functions for logging debug messages, and allows\nthe user to enable or disable logging for particular code modules.\n\nIt is sometimes practical to add a lot of debugging log messages to a\nprogram, but having them enabled all the time results in very large\nlog files. Also, logging that much takes quite a bit of time.\n\nThis module provides a way to turn such debugging or tracing messages\non and off, based on the filename they occur in. The logging can that\nbe left in the code, and only enabled when it is needed.\n",
