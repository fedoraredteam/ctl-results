You know, something that can parse command line\narguments and run other external programs via the shell. The kind of script\nyou can call with --help. Something that perhaps reads, copies, deletes, or\notherwise manipulates files by their pathname.\n\nIf any of these apply, perhaps this module is for you!\n\nA simple import script statement can provide your code with convenient command\nline parsing, \"a la carte\" --help documentation, useful path operations, shell\ncommand invocation with optional pipe redirection, and early run-time\ntermination with exit status control. Read on for more. Cheers!\n",
