            "Description": "\nThis module allows you to check an IP address against one or more IP\nranges. It employs Perl's highly optimized regular expression engine to do\nthe hard work, so it is very fast. It is optimized for speed by doing the\nmatch against a regexp which implicitly checks the broadest IP ranges\nfirst. An advantage is that the regexp can be computed and stored in\nadvance (in source code, in a database table, etc) and reused, saving much\ntime if the IP ranges don't change too often. The match can optionally\nreport a value (e.g. a network name) instead of just a boolean, which makes\nmodule useful for mapping IP ranges to names or codes or anything else.\n",
