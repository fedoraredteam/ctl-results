            "Description": "\nStarting with Perl 5.10, it is possible to create a lexical version of the\nPerl default variable $_.\n\nIt is occasionally useful for a subroutine to be able to access its caller's\n$_ variable regardless of whether it was lexical or not. The \"(_)\" sub\nprototype is the official way to do so, however there are sometimes\ndisadvantages to this.\n\nThe \"lexical::underscore\" function returns a scalar reference to either\na lexical $_ variable somewhere up the call stack (using PadWalker magic), or\nto the global $_ if there was no lexical version.\n",
