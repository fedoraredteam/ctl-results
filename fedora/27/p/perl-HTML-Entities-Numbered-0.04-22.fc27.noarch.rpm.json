When an argument of name2decimal() or name2hex() contains some\nnameable HTML entities, they will be replaced to numbered HTML entities.\nAnd when an argument of name2decimal_xml() or name2hex_xml() contains\nsome nameable numbered HTML entities, they will be replaced to numbered\nHTML entities except valid XML entities (the excepted \"valid XML\nentities\" are the following five entities: &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, &quot;,\n&apos;). By the same token, when an argument of decimal2name() or\nhex2name() contains some nameable numbered HTML entities, they will be\nreplaced to named HTML entities.\n",
