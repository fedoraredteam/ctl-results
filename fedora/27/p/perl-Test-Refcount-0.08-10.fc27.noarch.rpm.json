            "Description": "\nThe Perl garbage collector uses simple reference counting during the normal\nexecution of a program. This means that cycles or unweakened references in\nother parts of code can keep an object around for longer than intended. To\nhelp avoid this problem, the reference count of a new object from its class\nconstructor ought to be 1. This way, the caller can know the object will be\nproperly DESTROYed when it drops all of its references to it.\n",
