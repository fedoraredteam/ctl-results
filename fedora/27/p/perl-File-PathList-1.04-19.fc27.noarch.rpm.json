For example, perl itself when loading classes first turn\na \"Class::Name\" into a path like \"Class/Name.pm\", and then looks through each\nelement of @INC to find the actual file. To aid in portability, all relative\npaths are provided as UNIX-style relative paths, and converted to the\nlocalized version in the process of looking up the path.\n",
