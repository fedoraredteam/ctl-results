This allows you\n  to utilize other PSR-7 compatible libraries with Guzzle.\n* Abstracts away the underlying HTTP transport, allowing you to write\n  environment and transport agnostic code; i.e., no hard dependency on cURL,\n  PHP streams, sockets, or non-blocking event loops.\n* Middleware system allows you to augment and compose client behavior.\n\nAutoloader: /usr/share/php/GuzzleHttp6/autoload.php\n",
