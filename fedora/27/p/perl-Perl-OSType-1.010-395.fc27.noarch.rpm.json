            "Description": "\nModules that provide OS-specific behaviors often need to know if the current\noperating system matches a more generic type of operating systems. For example,\n'linux' is a type of 'Unix' operating system and so is 'freebsd'.\n\nThis module provides a mapping between an operating system name as given by $^O\nand a more generic type. The initial version is based on the OS type mappings\nprovided in Module::Build and ExtUtils::CBuilder (thus, Microsoft operating\nsystems are given the type 'Windows' rather than 'Win32').\n",
