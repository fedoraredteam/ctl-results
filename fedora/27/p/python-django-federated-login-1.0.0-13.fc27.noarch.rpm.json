The bridge is\npre-wired to be used with a single Google Apps domain, but could be\nextended to be linked with other OpenID providers also. It is different\nfrom other OpenID consumers as this consumer only allows connecting to\na pre-defined identity provider.\n\nThe provided backend matches users based on the e-mail address returned\nfrom the identity provider. If no matching user could be found, a user\naccount can optionally be created.\n",
