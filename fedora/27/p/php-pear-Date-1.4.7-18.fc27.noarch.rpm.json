Includes time zone data, time zone conversions and many date/time\nconversions.  It does not rely on 32-bit system date stamps, so you can display\ncalendars and compare dates that date pre 1970 and post 2038. This package also\nprovides a class to convert date strings between Gregorian and Human calendar\nformats.\n",
