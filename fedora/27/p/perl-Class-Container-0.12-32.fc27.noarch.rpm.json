It was first designed and built for \"HTML::Mason\", in\nwhich the Compiler, Lexer, Interpreter, Resolver, Component, Buffer, and\nseveral other objects must create each other transparently, passing the\nappropriate parameters to the right class, possibly substituting other\nsubclasses for any of these objects.\n\nThe main features of \"Class::Container\" are:\n\n*   Explicit declaration of containment relationships (aggregation,\n    factory creation, etc.)\n\n*   Declaration of constructor parameters accepted by each member in a\n    class framework\n\n*   Transparent passing of constructor parameters to the class that\n    needs them\n\n*   Ability to create one (automatic) or many (manual) contained objects\n    automatically and transparently\n",
