So the ssl package in the Standard Library of Python 3.2 now includes\na match_hostname() function for performing this check instead of requiring\nevery application to implement the check separately.\n\nThis backport brings match_hostname() to users of earlier versions of Python.\nThe actual code is only slightly modified from Python 3.5.\n",
