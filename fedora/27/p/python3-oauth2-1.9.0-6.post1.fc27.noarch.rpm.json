            "Description": "\nOauth2 was originally forked from Leah Culver and Andy Smith's oauth.py\ncode. Some of the tests come from a fork by Vic Fryzel, while a revamped\nRequest class and more tests were merged in from Mark Paschal's fork. A\nnumber of notable differences exist between this code and its forefathers:\n\n- 100% unit test coverage.\n- The DataStore object has been completely ripped out. While creating unit\n  tests for the library I found several substantial bugs with the\n  implementation and confirmed with Andy Smith that it was never fully\n  baked.\n- Classes are no longer prefixed with OAuth.\n- The Request class now extends from dict.\n- The library is likely no longer compatible with Python 2.3.\n- The Client class works and extends from httplib2. It's a thin wrapper\n  that handles automatically signing any normal HTTP request you might\n  wish to make.\n",
