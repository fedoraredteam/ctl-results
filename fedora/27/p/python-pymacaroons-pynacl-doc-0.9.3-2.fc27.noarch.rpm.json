Unlike\nopaque tokens, macaroons embed caveats that define specific authorization\nrequirements for the target service, the service that issued the root macaroon\nand which is capable of verifying the integrity of macaroons it receives.\n\nMacaroons allow for delegation and attenuation of authorization. They are\nsimple and fast to verify, and decouple authorization policy from the\nenforcement of that policy.\n",
