The\n  overhead compared to regular PHP code was reduced to the very minimum.\n\n* Secure: Twig has a sandbox mode to evaluate untrusted template code. This\n  allows Twig to be used as a template language for applications where users\n  may modify the template design.\n\n* Flexible: Twig is powered by a flexible lexer and parser. This allows the\n  developer to define its own custom tags and filters, and create its own\n  DSL.\n\nAutoloader: /usr/share/php/Twig/autoload.php\n",
