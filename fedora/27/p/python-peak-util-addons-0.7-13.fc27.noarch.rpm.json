            "Description": "\nIn any sufficiently-sized application or framework, it's common to end up\nlumping a lot of different concerns into the same class.  For example, you may\nhave business logic, persistence code, and UI all jammed into a single class.\nAttribute and method names for all sorts of different operations get shoved\ninto a single namespace -- even when using mixin classes.\n\nSeparating concerns into different objects, however, makes it easier to write\nreusable and separately-testable components.  The AddOns package\n(``peak.util.addons``) lets you manage concerns using ``AddOn`` classes.\n",
