It is\nroughly based on the API from the excellent Requests Python library.\nRequests is ISC Licensed (similar to the new BSD license) and has no\ndependencies, except for PHP 5.2+.\n\nDespite PHP's use as a language for the web, its tools for sending HTTP\nrequests are severely lacking. cURL has an interesting API, to say the\nleast, and you can't always rely on it being available. Sockets provide\nonly low level access, and require you to build most of the HTTP\nresponse parsing yourself.\n\nWe all have better things to do. That's why Requests was born.\n",
