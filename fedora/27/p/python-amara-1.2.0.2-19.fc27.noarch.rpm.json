Not just tools\nthat happen to be written in Python, but tools built from the ground up to use\nPython idioms and take advantage of the many advantages of Python over other\nprogramming languages.\n\nAmara builds on 4Suite, but whereas 4Suite focuses more on literal\nimplementation of XML standards in Python, Amara adds a much more Pythonic face\nto these capabilities.\n",
