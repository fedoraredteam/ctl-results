Nothing in this\ndistribution will magically make the Perl interpreter start checking a value's\ntype on assignment to a variable. In fact, there's no built-in way to apply a\ntype to a variable at all.\n\nInstead, you can explicitly check a value against a type, and optionally coerce\nvalues to that type.\n",
