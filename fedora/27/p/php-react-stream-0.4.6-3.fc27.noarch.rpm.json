They are very similar to the streams found in PHP itself,\nbut have an interface more suited for async I/O.\n\nMainly it provides interfaces for readable and writable streams, plus a file\ndescriptor based implementation with an in-memory write buffer.\n\nThis component depends on \u00e9v\u00e9nement, which is an implementation of the\nEventEmitter.\n\nAutoloader: /usr/share/php/React/Stream/autoload.php\n",
