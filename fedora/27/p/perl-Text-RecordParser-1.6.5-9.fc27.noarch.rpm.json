            "Description": "\nThis module is for reading record-oriented data in a delimited text file.\nThe most common example have records separated by newlines and fields\nseparated by commas or tabs, but this module aims to provide a consistent\ninterface for handling sequential records in a file however they may be\ndelimited. Typically this data lists the fields in the first line of the\nfile, in which case you should call bind_header to bind the field name (or\nnot, and it will be called implicitly). If the first line contains data,\nyou can still bind your own field names via bind_fields. Either way, you\ncan then use many methods to get at the data as arrays or hashes.\n",
