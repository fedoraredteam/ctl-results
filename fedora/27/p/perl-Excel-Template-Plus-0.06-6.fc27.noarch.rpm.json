            "Description": "\nThis module is an extension of the Excel::Template module, which allows\nthe user to use various \"engines\" from which you can create Excel files\nthrough Excel::Template.\nThe idea is to use the existing (and very solid) excel file generation\ncode in Excel::Template, but to extend its more templatey bits with more\npowerful options.\nThe only engine currently provided is the Template Toolkit engine, which\nreplaces Excel::Template's built in template features (the LOOP, and IF\nconstructs) with the full power of TT. This is similar to the module\nExcel::Template::TT, but expands on that even further to try and create\na more extensive system.\n",
