            "Description": "\nPhysicsFS is a library to provide abstract access to various archives. It is\nintended for use in video games, and the design was somewhat inspired by Quake\n3's file subsystem. The programmer defines a \"write directory\" on the physical\nfilesystem. No file writing done through the PhysicsFS API can leave that\nwrite directory, for security. For example, an embedded scripting language\ncannot write outside of this path if it uses PhysFS for all of its I/O, which\nmeans that untrusted scripts can run more safely. Symbolic links can be\ndisabled as well, for added safety. For file reading, the programmer lists\ndirectories and archives that form a \"search path\". Once the search path is\ndefined, it becomes a single, transparent hierarchical filesystem. This makes\nfor easy access to ZIP files in the same way as you access a file directly on\nthe disk, and it makes it easy to ship a new archive that will override a\nprevious archive on a per-file basis. Finally, PhysicsFS gives you\nplatform-abstracted means to determine if CD-ROMs are available, the user's\nhome directory, where in the real filesystem your program is running, etc.\n",
