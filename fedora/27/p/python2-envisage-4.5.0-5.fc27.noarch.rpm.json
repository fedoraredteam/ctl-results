            "Description": "\nEnvisage is a Python-based framework for building extensible applications,\nthat is, applications whose functionality can be extended by adding\n\"plug-ins\".  Envisage provides a standard mechanism for features to be added\nto an application, whether by the original developer or by someone else.  In\nfact, when you build an application using Envisage, the entire application\nconsists primarily of plug-ins.  In this respect, it is similar to the Eclipse\nand Netbeans frameworks for Java applications.\n\nEach plug-in is able to:\n\n* Advertise where and how it can be extended (its \"extension points\").\n* Contribute extensions to the extension points offered by other plug-ins.\n* Create and share the objects that perform the real work of the application\n  (\"services\").\n\nThe Envisage project provides the basic machinery of the plug-in framework as\nwell as GUI building tools (envisage.ui).  The workbench is the older way to\nbuild GUIs from Envisage.  It is now recommended to use the Task framework.\n",
