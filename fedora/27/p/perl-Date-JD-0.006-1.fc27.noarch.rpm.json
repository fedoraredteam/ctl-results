            "Description": "\nFor date and time calculations it is convenient to represent dates by a\nsimple linear count of days, rather than in a particular calendar. This is\nsuch a good idea that it has been invented several times. If there were a\nsingle such linear count then it would be the obvious data interchange\nformat between calendar modules. With several versions, calendar modules\ncan use such sensible data formats and still have interoperability\nproblems. This module tackles that problem, by performing conversions\nbetween different flavors of day count. These day count systems are\ngenerically known as \"Julian Dates\", after the most venerable of them.\n",
