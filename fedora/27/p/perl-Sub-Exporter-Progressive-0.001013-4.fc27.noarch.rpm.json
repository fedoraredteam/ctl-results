            "Description": "\nSub::Exporter is an incredibly powerful module, but with that power comes\ngreat responsibility, er- as well as some runtime penalties. This module is a\nSub::Exporter wrapper that will let your users just use Exporter if all they\nare doing is picking exports, but use Sub::Exporter if your users try to use\nSub::Exporter's more advanced features, like renaming exports, if they try to\nuse them.\n\nNote that this module will export @EXPORT and @EXPORT_OK package variables for\nExporter to work. Additionally, if your package uses advanced Sub::Exporter\nfeatures like currying, this module will only ever use Sub::Exporter, so you\nmight as well use it directly.\n",
