            "Description": "\nThe main problem with Data::Dumper (one of my all-time favorite modules)\nis that you have to use 'eval()' to deserialize the data you've dumped.\nThis is great if you can trust the data you're evaling, but horrible if\nyou can't. A good alternative is Storable.pm. It can safely thaw your\nfrozen data.  But if you want to read/edit the frozen data, you're out of\nluck, because Storable uses a binary format. Even Data::Dumper's output\ncan be a little cumbersome for larger data objects. Enter Data::Denter.\n\nData::Denter is yet another Perl data serializer/deserializer. It formats\nnested data structures in an indented fashion. It is optimized for human\nreadability/editability, safe deserialization, and (eventually) speed.\n",
