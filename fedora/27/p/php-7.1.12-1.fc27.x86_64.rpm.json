            "Description": "\nPHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. PHP attempts to make it\neasy for developers to write dynamically generated web pages. PHP also\noffers built-in database integration for several commercial and\nnon-commercial database management systems, so writing a\ndatabase-enabled webpage with PHP is fairly simple. The most common\nuse of PHP coding is probably as a replacement for CGI scripts.\n\nThe php package contains the module (often referred to as mod_php)\nwhich adds support for the PHP language to Apache HTTP Server.\n",
