            "Description": "\nThe pytest-xdist plugin extends py.test with some unique test execution modes:\n* test run parallelization: if you have multiple CPUs or hosts you can use\n  those for a combined test run. This allows to speed up development or to use\n  special resources of remote machines.\n* --boxed: run each test in a boxed subprocess to survive SEGFAULTS or\n  otherwise dying processes\n* --looponfail: run your tests repeatedly in a subprocess. After each run\n  py.test waits until a file in your project changes and then re-runs the\n  previously failing tests. This is repeated until all tests pass after which\n  again a full run is performed.\n* Multi-Platform coverage: you can specify different Python interpreters or\n  different platforms and run tests in parallel on all of them.\n",
