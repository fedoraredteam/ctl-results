            "Description": "\ncloudpickle makes it possible to serialize Python constructs\nnot supported by the default pickle module from the Python standard\nlibrary. cloudpickle is especially useful for cluster computing where\nPython expressions are shipped over the network to execute on remote\nhosts, possibly close to the data. Among other things, cloudpickle\nsupports pickling for lambda expressions, functions and classes defined\ninteractively in the __main__ module.\n",
