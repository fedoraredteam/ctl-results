The implementation is entirely Object\nOriented, as there is quite a lot of context inherent in making blowfish\nas fast as it is. The key is anywhere between 64 and 448 bits (8 and 56\nbytes), and should be passed as a packed string. The transformation itself\nis a 16-round Feistel Network, and operates on a 64 bit block.\n",
