            "Description": "\nTesting is usually the ugly part of Perl module authoring. Perl gives you a\nstandard way to run tests with Test::Harness, and basic testing primitives\nwith Test::More. After that you are pretty much on your own to develop a\ntesting framework and philosophy. Test::More encourages you to make your\nown framework by subclassing Test::Builder, but that is not trivial.\n\nTest::Base gives you a way to write your own test framework base class that\n*is* trivial.\n",
