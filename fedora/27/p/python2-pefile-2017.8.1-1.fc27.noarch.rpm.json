Most of the information in the PE Header is\naccessible, as well as all the sections, section's information and data.\npefile requires some basic understanding of the layout of a PE file. Armed\nwith it it's possible to explore nearly every single feature of the file.\nSome of the tasks that pefile makes possible are:\n* Modifying and writing back to the PE image\n* Header Inspection\n* Sections analysis\n* Retrieving data\n* Warnings for suspicious and malformed values\n* Packer detection with PEiD\u2019s signatures\n* PEiD signature generation\n",
