            "Description": "\nROOT is a powerful data analysis tool within the particle physics community,\nand the primary lens through which we see our data. The framework includes\nquite a bit of graphical capabilities, but producing high-quality graphics\noutput was not the first priority in designing its capabilities\nor its interface.\n\nIt becomes useful, then, to consider using an outside library\nfocused on graphics for producing final plots. The pyROOT\ninterface to ROOT makes it easy to have ROOT objects interact with\nother python modules. The goal of rootplot is to enable easy\nplotting of ROOT histograms using the full-featured and mature\nmatplotlib library.\n",
