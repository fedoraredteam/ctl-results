            "Description": "\nThe \"IO::String\" module provides the \"IO::File\" interface for in-core\nstrings.  An \"IO::String\" object can be attached to a string, and\nmakes it possible to use the normal file operations for reading or\nwriting data, as well as for seeking to various locations of the\nstring.  This is useful when you want to use a library module that\nonly provides an interface to file handles on data that you have in a\nstring variable.\n\nNote that perl-5.8 and better has built-in support for \"in memory\"\nfiles, which are set up by passing a reference instead of a filename\nto the open() call. The reason for using this module is that it makes\nthe code backwards compatible with older versions of Perl.\n",
