They provide support for basic\nauthentication and authorization as well as support for persistent database\nconnections via Perl's Database Independent Interface (DBI).\n\no DBI.pm provides persistent database connections:\n  - connections can be established during server-startup\n  - configurable rollback to ensure data integrity\n  - configurable verification of the connections to avoid time-outs.\n\no AuthDBI.pm provides authentication and authorization:\n  - optional shared cache for passwords to minimize database load\n  - configurable cleanup-handler deletes outdated entries from the cache\n\nApache::DBI has been in widespread deployment on many platforms for\nyears.  Apache::DBI is one of the most widely used mod_perl related\nmodules.  It can be considered stable.\n",
