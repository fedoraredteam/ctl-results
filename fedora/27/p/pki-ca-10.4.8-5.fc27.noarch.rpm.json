            "Description": "\nThe Certificate Authority (CA) is a required PKI subsystem which issues,\nrenews, revokes, and publishes certificates as well as compiling and\npublishing Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).\n\nThe Certificate Authority can be configured as a self-signing Certificate\nAuthority, where it is the root CA, or it can act as a subordinate CA,\nwhere it obtains its own signing certificate from a public CA.\n\nThis package is one of the top-level java-based Tomcat PKI subsystems\nprovided by the PKI Core used by the Certificate System.\n\n\n==================================\n||  ABOUT \"CERTIFICATE SYSTEM\"  ||\n==================================\n\nCertificate System (CS) is an enterprise software system designed\nto manage enterprise Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) deployments.\n\nPKI Core contains ALL top-level java-based Tomcat PKI components:\n\n  * pki-symkey\n  * pki-base\n  * pki-base-python2 (alias for pki-base)\n  * pki-base-python3\n  * pki-base-java\n  * pki-tools\n  * pki-server\n  * pki-ca\n  * pki-kra\n  * pki-ocsp\n  * pki-tks\n  * pki-tps\n  * pki-javadoc\n\nwhich comprise the following corresponding PKI subsystems:\n\n  * Certificate Authority (CA)\n  * Key Recovery Authority (KRA)\n  * Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Manager\n  * Token Key Service (TKS)\n  * Token Processing Service (TPS)\n\nPython clients need only install the pki-base package.  This\npackage contains the python REST client packages and the client\nupgrade framework.\n\nJava clients should install the pki-base-java package.  This package\ncontains the legacy and REST Java client packages.  These clients\nshould also consider installing the pki-tools package, which contain\nnative and Java-based PKI tools and utilities.\n\nCertificate Server instances require the fundamental classes and\nmodules in pki-base and pki-base-java, as well as the utilities in\npki-tools.  The main server classes are in pki-server, with subsystem\nspecific Java classes and resources in pki-ca, pki-kra, pki-ocsp etc.\n\nFinally, if Certificate System is being deployed as an individual or\nset of standalone rather than embedded server(s)/service(s), it is\nstrongly recommended (though not explicitly required) to include at\nleast one PKI Theme package:\n\n  * dogtag-pki-theme (Dogtag Certificate System deployments)\n    * dogtag-pki-server-theme\n  * redhat-pki-server-theme (Red Hat Certificate System deployments)\n    * redhat-pki-server-theme\n  * customized pki theme (Customized Certificate System deployments)\n    * <customized>-pki-server-theme\n\n  NOTE:  As a convenience for standalone deployments, top-level meta\n         packages may be provided which bind a particular theme to\n         these certificate server packages.\n",
