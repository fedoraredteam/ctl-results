            "Description": "\nFSDB is a package of commands for manipulating flat-ASCII databases from\nshell scripts.  FSDB is useful to process medium amounts of data (with\nvery little data you'd do it by hand, with megabytes you might want a\nreal database).  FSDB is very good at doing things like:\n\n        - extracting measurements from experimental output\n        - re-examining data to address different hypotheses\n        - joining data from different experiments\n        - eliminating/detecting outliers\n        - computing statistics on data (mean, confidence intervals,\n                correlations, histograms)\n        - reformatting data for graphing programs\n\nRather than hand-code scripts to do each special case, FSDB provides\nhigher-level functions than one gets with raw perl or shell scripts.\n(Some features:  control uses names instead of column numbers,\nit is self-documenting, and is robust with good error and memory handling.)\n",
