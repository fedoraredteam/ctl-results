PDF stands for\nPortable Document Format.\n\nDocuments can have several pages, a table of content, an information section\nand many other PDF elements. More functionalities will be added as needs arise.\n\nDocuments are constructed on the fly so the memory footprint is not tied to the\nsize of the pages but only to their number.\n",
