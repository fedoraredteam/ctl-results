            "Description": "\n\nThis package provides a Python 3 ported version of Python 2.7's random\nmodule.  It has also been back-ported to work in Python 2.6.\n\nIn Python 3, the implementation of randrange() was changed, so that even\nwith the same seed you get different sequences in Python 2 and 3.  Note\nthat several high-level functions such as randint() and choice() use\nrandrange().\n\nIn my testing code I heavily rely on stable random generator results and\nit makes porting code to Python 3 a lot harder, if all those tests have\nto be adjusted.  This package fixes that.\n",
