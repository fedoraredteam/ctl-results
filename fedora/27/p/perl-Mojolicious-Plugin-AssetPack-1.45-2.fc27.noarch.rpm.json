            "Description": "\nMojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack is a Mojolicious plugin which can be used to\ncram multiple assets of the same type into one file. This means that if you\nhave a lot of CSS files (.css, .less, .sass, ...) as input, the AssetPack\ncan make one big CSS file as output. This is good, since it will often\nspeed up the rendering of your page. The output file can even be minified,\nmeaning you can save bandwidth and browser parsing time.\n",
