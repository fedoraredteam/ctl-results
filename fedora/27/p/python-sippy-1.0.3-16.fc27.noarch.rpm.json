            "Description": "\nThis ia a RFC3261-compliant Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Back-to-back\nuser agent (B2BUA) server software.\n\nThe B2BUA is a SIP call controlling component. Unlike a SIP proxy server,\nwhich only maintains transaction state, the B2BUA maintains complete call\nstate and participates in all call requests. For this reason it can perform\nnumber of functions that are not possible to implement using SIP proxy,\nsuch as for example accurate call accounting, pre-paid rating and billing,\nfail over call routing etc. Unlike PBX-type solutions such as Asterisk for\nexample, the B2BUA doesn't perform any media relaying or processing,\ntherefore it doesn't introduce any additional packet loss, delay or jitter\ninto the media path.\n",
