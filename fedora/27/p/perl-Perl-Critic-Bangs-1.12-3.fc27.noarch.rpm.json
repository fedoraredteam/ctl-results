It should be removed.\n  - Watch for comments like \"XXX\", \"TODO\", etc.\n  - Tests should have a plan.\n  - Variables like $user and $user2 are insufficiently distinguished.\n  - Determining the class in a constructor by using \"ref($proto) || $proto\".\n  - Adding modifiers to a regular expression made up entirely of a variable\n  created with qr() is usually not doing what you expect.\n  - Vague variables like $data or $info are not descriptive enough.\n",
