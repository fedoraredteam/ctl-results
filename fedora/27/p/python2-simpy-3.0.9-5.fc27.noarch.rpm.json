It\nprovides the modeler with components of a simulation model including\nprocesses, for active components like customers, messages, and\nvehicles, and resources, for passive components that form limited\ncapacity congestion points like servers, checkout counters, and\ntunnels. It also provides monitor variables to aid in gathering\nstatistics. Random variates are provided by the standard Python random\nmodule.\n",
