It acts as WSGI middleware.\n\nrepoze.who is inspired by Zope 2's Pluggable Authentication Service (PAS) (but\nrepoze.who is not dependent on Zope in any way; it is useful for any WSGI\napplication).  It provides no facility for authorization (ensuring whether a\nuser can or cannot perform the operation implied by the request).  This is\nconsidered to be the domain of the WSGI application.\n",
