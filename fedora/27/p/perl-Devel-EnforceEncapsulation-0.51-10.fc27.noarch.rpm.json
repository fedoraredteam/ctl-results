            "Description": "\nEncapsulation is the practice of creating subroutines to access the properties\nof a class instead of accessing those properties directly. The advantage of\ngood encapsulation is that the author is permitted to change the internal\nimplementation of a class without breaking its usage.\n\nObject-oriented programming in Perl is most commonly implemented via blessed\nhashes. This practice makes it easy for users of a class to violate\nencapsulation by simply accessing the hash values directly. Although less\ncommon, the same applies to classes implemented via blessed arrays, scalars,\nfilehandles, etc.\n\nThis module is a hack to block those direct accesses. If you try to access a\nhash value of an object from its own class, or a superclass or subclass, all\ngoes well. If you try to access a hash value from any other package, an\nexception is thrown. The same applies to the scalar value of a blessed scalar,\nentry in a blessed array, etc.\n\nTo be clear: this class is NOT intended for strict enforcement of\nencapsulation. If you want bullet-proof encapsulation, use inside-out objects\nor the like. Instead, this module is intended to be a development or debugging\naid in catching places where direct access is used against classes implemented\nas blessed hashes.\n\nTo repeat: the encapsulation enforced here is a hack and is easily\ncircumvented. Please use this module for good (finding bugs), not evil (making\nlife harder for downstream developers).\n",
