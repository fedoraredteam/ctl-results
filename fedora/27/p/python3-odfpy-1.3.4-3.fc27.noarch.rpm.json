            "Description": "\nOdfpy aims to be a complete API for OpenDocument in Python. Unlike\nother more convenient APIs, this one is essentially an abstraction\nlayer just above the XML format. The main focus has been to prevent\nthe programmer from creating invalid documents. It has checks that\nraise an exception if the programmer adds an invalid element, adds an\nattribute unknown to the grammar, forgets to add a required attribute\nor adds text to an element that doesn't allow it.\n\nThese checks and the API itself were generated from the RelaxNG\nschema, and then hand-edited. Therefore the API is complete and can\nhandle all ODF constructions, but could be improved in its\nunderstanding of data types.\n\nThis package provides Python 3 build of odfpy.\n",
