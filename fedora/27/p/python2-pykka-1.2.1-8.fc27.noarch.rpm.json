            "Description": "\nThe goal of Pykka is to provide easy to use concurrency abstractions for Python\nby using the actor model.\n\nPykka provides an actor API with two different implementations:\n\n * ThreadingActor is built on the Python Standard Library\u2019s threading and Queue\n   modules, and has no dependencies outside Python itself. It plays well\n   together with non-actor threads.\n * GeventActor is built on the gevent library. gevent is a coroutine-based\n   Python networking library that uses greenlet to provide a high-level\n   synchronous API on top of libevent event loop. It is generally faster, but\n   doesn't like playing with other threads.\n\nMuch of the naming in Pykka is inspired by the Akka project which implements\nactors on the JVM. Though, Pykka does not aim to be a Python port of Akka.\n\nThis package provides Pykka's Python 2 libraries\n",
