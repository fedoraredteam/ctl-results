It exists to define a common API for\napplications to use when they wish to load configuration. The library\nitself does not aim to handle anything except a basic API that\napplications may use to find and load configuration settings. Any\nspecific constraints should be implemented in a loader which can be\nregistered via an entry point.\n",
