Using this it is possible to refer to methods, properties and\nclass constants but also functions and global constants.\n\nThis package provides two Resolvers that are capable of:\n1. Returning a series of Value Object for given expression while resolving any\n  partial class names, and\n2. Returning an FQSEN object after resolving any partial Structural Element\n  Names into Fully Qualified Structural Element names.\n\nAutoloader: /usr/share/php/phpDocumentor/Reflection/autoload-type-resolver.php\n",
