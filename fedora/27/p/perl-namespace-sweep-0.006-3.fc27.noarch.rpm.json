            "Description": "\nBecause Perl methods are just regular subroutines, it's difficult to tell\nwhat's a method and what's just an imported function. As a result, imported\nfunctions can be called as methods on your objects. This pragma will delete\nimported functions from your class's symbol table, thereby ensuring that\nyour interface is as you specified it. However, code inside your module\nwill still be able to use the imported functions without any problems.\n",
