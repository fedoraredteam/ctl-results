            "Description": "\nThe IPTables::ChainMgr package provides an interface to manipulate iptables\npolicies on Linux systems through the direct execution of iptables\ncommands. Although making a perl extension of libiptc provided by the iptables\nproject is possible, it is easy to just execute iptables commands directly in\norder to both parse and change the configuration of the policy. Further, this\nsimplifies installation since the only external requirement is (in the spirit\nof scripting) to be able to point IPTables::ChainMgr at an installed iptables\nbinary instead of having to compile against a library.\n",
