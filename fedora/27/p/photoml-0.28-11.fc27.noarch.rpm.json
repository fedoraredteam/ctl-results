            "Description": "\nPhoto Description Markup Language (PhotoML) is primarily intended to\nprovide an XML format and tools for describing details of photo\ncreation, processing, and content in a collection of photographs. It\nis designed to be appropriate for a wide variety of photographic\nformats, including roll film (such as 35mm and 120/220), sheet film\n(such as 4x5 and 8x10) and digital images. The type of information\nrepresented, while allowing description of details of content,\ncreation etc. for digital images, does not support some of the more\nlow-level housekeeping details that might be necessary in an\napplication such as an online database of digital images. In\nparticular, PhotoML is not yet another web photo gallery generator.\n",
