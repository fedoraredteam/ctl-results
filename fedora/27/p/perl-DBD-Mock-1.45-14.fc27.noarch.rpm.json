            "Description": "\nTesting with databases can be tricky. If you are developing a system\nmarried to a single database then you can make some assumptions about your\nenvironment and ask the user to provide relevant connection information.\nBut if you need to test a framework that uses DBI, particularly a framework\nthat uses different types of persistence schemes, then it may be more\nuseful to simply verify what the framework is trying to do -- ensure the\nright SQL is generated and that the correct parameters are bound. DBD::Mock\nmakes it easy to just modify your configuration (presumably held outside\nyour code) and just use it instead of DBD::Foo (like DBD::Pg or DBD::mysql)\nin your framework.\n",
