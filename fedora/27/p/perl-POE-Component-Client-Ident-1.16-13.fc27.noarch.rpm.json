The Ident protocol is described in RFC 1413\n<http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1413.html>.\n\nPOE::Component::Client::Ident::Agent is a POE component that provides\na single \"one shot\" lookup of a user name on the remote side of a TCP\nconnection to other components and sessions, using the ident (auth/tap)\nprotocol.\n\nPOE::Filter::Ident takes lines of raw Ident input and turns\nthem into weird little data structures, suitable for feeding to\nPOE::Component::Client::Ident::Agent.\n",
