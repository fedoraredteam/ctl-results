You can use pages, images,\nfonts and Acrobat JavaScript from old PDF-files (if they were not\nencrypted), and rearrange the components, and add new graphics, texts etc.\n\nThere is also support for graphics. In the tutorial there is a description of\nhow to transform simple PDF-pages to graphic Perl objects with the help of\nprograms based on this module.\n\nThe module is fairly fast, so it should be possible to use it for mass\nproduction.\n",
