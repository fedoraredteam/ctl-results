Also it includes 2 utilities based on raw ip,\ntraceroute and ping.\n\nThe primary motivation for this project is to fill the blank in Python, i.e.,\nhandling raw ip packet. Meanwhile, the utility 'traceroute' is intended to be\nport of Unix 'traceroute' to Windows platform, as Windows' tracert has only\nvery limited command line options compared with Unix 'traceroute'.\n",
