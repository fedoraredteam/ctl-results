            "Description": "\n  hKit is a simple toolkit for extracting common microformats from a page.\nThe page can be presented as a string or a URL, and the result is handed\nback as a standard PHP array structure. hKit uses SimpleXML for parsing,\nand therefore requires PHP5.\n  Designed for humans first and machines second, microformats are a set of\nsimple, open data formats built upon existing and widely adopted standards.\n  The only microformat module currently supported by hKit is hCard. However,\nhKit makes possible for a user to write its own microformat module.\n",
