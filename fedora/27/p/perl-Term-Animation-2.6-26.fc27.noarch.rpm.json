            "Description": "\nThis module provides a framework to produce sprite animations using ASCII art.\nEach ASCII 'sprite' is given one or more frames, and placed into the animation\nas an 'animation object'. An animation object can have a callback routine that\ncontrols the position and frame of the object.\n\nIf the constructor is passed no arguments, it assumes that it is running full\nscreen, and behaves accordingly. Alternatively, it can accept a curses window\n(created with the Curses new win call) as an argument, and will draw into that\nwindow.\n",
