Such analysis includes check for removed\npackages, packages replaced by partially incompatible packages, changes in\nlibraries, users and groups and various services. Report of this analysis\ncan help the admin with the inplace upgrade - by identification of potential\ntroubles and by mitigating some of the incompatibilities. Data gathered\nby preupgrade assistant can be used for the \"cloning\" of the system - new,\nclean installation of the system, as close as possible to the old Fedora setup.\nIn addition, it provides some postupgrade scripts which are supposed to finish\nmigration after the installation of Fedora system.\n",
