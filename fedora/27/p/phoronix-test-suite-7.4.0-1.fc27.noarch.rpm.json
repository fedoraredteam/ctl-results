This software is designed to\neffectively carry out both qualitative and quantitative benchmarks in a clean,\nreproducible, and easy-to-use manner. The Phoronix Test Suite consists of a\nlightweight processing core (pts-core) with each benchmark consisting of an\nXML-based profile with related resource scripts. The process from the benchmark\ninstallation, to the actual benchmarking, to the parsing of important hardware\nand software components is heavily automated and completely repeatable, asking\nusers only for confirmation of actions.\n",
