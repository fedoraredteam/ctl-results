            "Description": "\nThis perhaps ridiculous-seeming module was created to test routines that\nmanipulate random numbers by providing a known output from rand. Given a\nlist of seeds with srand, it will return each in turn. After seeded\nrandom numbers are exhausted, it will always return 0. Seed numbers must\nbe of a form that meets the expected output from rand as called with no\narguments -- i.e. they must be between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).\nIn order to facilitate generating and testing a nearly-one number, this\nmodule exports the function oneish, which returns a number just\nfractionally less than one.\n",
