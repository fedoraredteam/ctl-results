            "Description": "\nSendmail::PMilter is a mail filtering API implementing the Sendmail milter\nprotocol in pure Perl. This allows Sendmail servers (and perhaps other MTAs\nimplementing milter) to filter and modify mail in transit during the SMTP\nconnection, all in Perl.\n\nIt should be noted that PMilter 0.90 and later is NOT compatible with\nscripts written for PMilter 0.5 and earlier.  The API has been reworked\nsignificantly, and the enhanced APIs and rule logic provided by PMilter\n0.5 and earlier has been factored out for inclusion in a separate package\ncalled Mail::Milter.\n",
