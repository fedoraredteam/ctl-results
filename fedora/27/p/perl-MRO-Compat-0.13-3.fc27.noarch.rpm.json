That is to say,\ncode which properly uses MRO::Compat will work unmodified on both older\nPerls and 5.9.5+.\n\nIf you're writing a piece of software that would like to use the parts\nof 5.9.5+'s mro:: interfaces that are supported here, and you want\ncompatibility with older Perls, this is the module for you.\n",
