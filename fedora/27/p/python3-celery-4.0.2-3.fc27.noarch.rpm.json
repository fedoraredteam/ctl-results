It is focused on real-time\noperation, but supports scheduling as well.\n\nThe execution units, called tasks, are executed concurrently\non one or more worker nodes using multiprocessing, Eventlet\nor gevent. Tasks can execute asynchronously (in the background)\nor synchronously (wait until ready).\n\nCelery is used in production systems to process millions of\ntasks a day.\n\nCelery is written in Python, but the protocol can be implemented\nin any language. It can also operate with other languages using\nweb hooks.\n\nThe recommended message broker is RabbitMQ, but limited support\nfor Redis, Beanstalk, MongoDB, CouchDB and databases\n(using SQLAlchemy or the Django ORM) is also available.\n",
