The project includes a python\nlibrary to parse rST files and transform them into other useful formats such\nas HTML, XML, and TeX as well as commandline tools that give the enduser\naccess to this functionality.\n\nCurrently, the library supports parsing rST that is in standalone files and\nPEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals).  Work is underway to parse rST from\nPython inline documentation modules and packages.\n\nThis package contains the module, ported to run under python3.\n",
