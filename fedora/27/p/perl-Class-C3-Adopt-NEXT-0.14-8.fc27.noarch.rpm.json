            "Description": "\nNEXT was a good solution a few years ago, but isn't any more. It's\nslow, and the order in which it re-dispatches methods appears random\nat times. It also encourages bad programming practices, as you end up\nwith code to redispatch methods when all you really wanted to do was\nrun some code before or after a method fired.  However, if you have a large\napplication, then weaning yourself off 'NEXT' isn't easy.This module is\nintended as a drop-in replacement for NEXT, supporting the same interface,\nbut using Class::C3 to do the hard work. You can then write new code\nwithout 'NEXT', and migrate individual source files to use 'Class::C3'\nor method modifiers as appropriate, at whatever pace you're comfortable with.\n",
