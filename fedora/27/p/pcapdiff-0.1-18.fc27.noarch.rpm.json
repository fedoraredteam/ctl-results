            "Description": "\nPcapdiff is a tool developed by the EFF to compare two packet captures and\nidentify potentially forged, dropped, or mangled packets. Two technically-\ninclined friends can set up packet captures (e.g. tcpdump or Wireshark) on\ntheir own computers and produce network traffic between their two computers\nover the Internet. Later, they can run pcapdiff on the two packet capture\nfiles to identify suspicious packets for further investigation. See\nDetecting packet injection: a guide to observing packet spoofing by ISPs\nand EFF's Test Your ISP Project for more background.\n",
