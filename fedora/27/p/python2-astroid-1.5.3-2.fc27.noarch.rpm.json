It\nrebuilds the tree generated by the builtin _ast module by recursively walking\ndown the AST and building an extended ast. The new node classes have additional\nmethods and attributes for different usages. They include some support for\nstatic inference and local name scopes. Furthermore, astroid builds partial\ntrees by inspecting living objects.\n\nThis package provides the Python 2 implementation.\n",
