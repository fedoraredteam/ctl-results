For example, depending on the platform, Firefox\ncan be distributed as a zip, tar.bz2, exe or dmg file or cloned from a\nrepository. Mozinstall takes the hassle out of extracting and/or\nrunning these files and for convenience returns the full path to the\napplication's binary in the install directory. In the case that\nmozinstall is invoked from the command line, the binary path will be\nprinted to standard output.\n",
