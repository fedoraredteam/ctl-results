            "Description": "\nwstool provides commands to manage several local SCM repositories (supports\ngit, mercurial, subversion, bazaar) based on a single workspace definition file\n(.rosinstall).\n\nwstool replaces the rosws tool for catkin workspaces. As catkin workspaces\ncreate their own setup file and environment, wstool is reduced to version\ncontrol functions only. So wstool does not have a \"regenerate\" command, and\ndoes not allow adding non-version controlled elements to workspaces. In all\nother respects, it behaves the same as rosws.\n",
