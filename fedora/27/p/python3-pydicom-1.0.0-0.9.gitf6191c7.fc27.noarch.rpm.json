The\nmodifications can be written again to a new file.\n\npydicom is not a DICOM server, and is not primarily about viewing images. It is\ndesigned to let you manipulate data elements in DICOM files with python code.\n\nLimitations -- the main limitation of the current version is that compressed\npixel data (e.g. JPEG) cannot be altered in an intelligent way as it can for\nuncompressed pixels. Files can always be read and saved, but compressed pixel\ndata cannot easily be modified.\n\nPython 3 version.\n",
