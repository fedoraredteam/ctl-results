This will allow other packages such as namespace::autoclean to\noperate without blowing away your overloads. After using\nMooseX::MarkAsMethods your overloads will be recognized by Class::MOP as\nbeing methods, and class extension as well as composition from roles with\noverloads will \"just work\".\n",
