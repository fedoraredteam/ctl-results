            "Description": "\nPOE::Component::Logger provides a simple logging component that uses\nLog::Dispatch::Config to drive it, allowing you to log to multiple places at\nonce (e.g. to STDERR and Syslog at the same time) and also to flexibly define\nyour logger's output.\n\nIt is very simple to use, because it creates a Logger::log method (yes, this\nis namespace corruption, so shoot me). If you don't like this, feel free to\npost directly to your logger as follows:\n\n  $kernel->post('logger', 'log', \"An error occurred: $!\");\n\nAll logging is done in the background, so don't expect immediate output -\nthe output will only occur after control goes back to the kernel so it can\nprocess the next event.\n",
