It is friendlier to use than File::Spec and provides easy access to\nfunctions from several other core file handling modules.\n\nIt doesn't attempt to be as full-featured as IO::All or Path::Class, nor does\nit try to work for anything except Unix-like and Win32 platforms. Even then, it\nmight break if you try something particularly obscure or tortuous.\n\nAll paths are forced to have Unix-style forward slashes. Stringifying the\nobject gives you back the path (after some clean up).\n\nFile input/output methods flock handles before reading or writing, as\nappropriate.\n\nThe *_utf8 methods (slurp_utf8, lines_utf8, etc.) operate in raw mode without\nCRLF translation.\n",
