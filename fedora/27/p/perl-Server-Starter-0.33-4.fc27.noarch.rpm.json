            "Description": "\nIt is often a pain to write a server program that supports graceful\nrestarts, with no resource leaks. Server::Starter, solves the problem by\nsplitting the task into two. One is start_server, a script provided as a\npart of the module, which works as a superdaemon that binds to zero or\nmore TCP ports, and repeatedly spawns the server program that actually\nhandles the necessary tasks (for example, responding to incoming\nconnections). The spawned server programs under Server::Starter call\naccept(2) and handle the requests.\n",
