It is meant to work with PHP 3 and\nabove.\n\nThe preferred (most secure) hashing method supported by phpass is the\nOpenBSD-style Blowfish-based bcrypt and known in PHP as CRYPT_BLOWFISH, with\na fallback to BSDI-style extended DES-based hashes, known in PHP as\nCRYPT_EXT_DES, and a last resort fallback to MD5-based salted and variable\niteration count password hashes implemented in phpass\nitself (also referred to as portable hashes).\n",
