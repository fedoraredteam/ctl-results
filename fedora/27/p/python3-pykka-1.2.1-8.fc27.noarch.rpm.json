            "Description": "\nThe goal of Pykka is to provide easy to use concurrency abstractions for Python\nby using the actor model.\n\nPykka for Python 3 provides an actor API with one implementation:\n\n * ThreadingActor is built on the Python Standard Library\u2019s threading and Queue\n   modules, and has no dependencies outside Python itself. It plays well\n   together with non-actor threads.\n\nMuch of the naming in Pykka is inspired by the Akka project which implements\nactors on the JVM. Though, Pykka does not aim to be a Python port of Akka.\n\nThis package provides Pykka's Python 3 libraries\n",
