            "Description": "\nPCRE2 is a re-working of the original PCRE (Perl-compatible regular\nexpression) library to provide an entirely new API.\n\nPCRE2 is written in C, and it has its own API. There are three sets of\nfunctions, one for the 8-bit library, which processes strings of bytes, one\nfor the 16-bit library, which processes strings of 16-bit values, and one for\nthe 32-bit library, which processes strings of 32-bit values. There are no C++\nwrappers. This package provides support for strings in 8-bit and UTF-8\nencodings. Install pcre2-utf16 or pcre2-utf32 packages for the other ones.\n\nThe distribution does contain a set of C wrapper functions for the 8-bit\nlibrary that are based on the POSIX regular expression API (see the pcre2posix\nman page). These can be found in a library called libpcre2posix. Note that\nthis just provides a POSIX calling interface to PCRE2; the regular expressions\nthemselves still follow Perl syntax and semantics. The POSIX API is\nrestricted, and does not give full access to all of PCRE2's facilities.\n",
