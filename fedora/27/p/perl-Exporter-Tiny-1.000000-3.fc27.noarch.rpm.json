But it's written in only about 40%\nas many lines of code and with zero non-core dependencies.\n\nIts internal-facing interface is closer to Exporter.pm, with configuration\ndone through the @EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK and %EXPORT_TAGS package variables.\n\nExporter::Tiny performs most of its internal duties (including resolution of\ntag names to sub names, resolution of sub names to coderefs, and installation\nof coderefs into the target package) as method calls, which means they can be\noverridden to provide interesting behavior.\n",
