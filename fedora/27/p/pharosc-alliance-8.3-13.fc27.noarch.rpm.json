            "Description": "\nThe libraries have been characterised in a generic 0.13\u00b5m\ntechnology. The spice model comes from the University of California,\nBerkeley, and the layout rules are slightly oversized 0.13\u00b5m ones\nwhich should make the layout compatible with most foundry rules\n\nThe vxlib is compatible with the sxlib created by the Alliance\nsoftware authors. The vsclib is a completely new library design.\nThe wsclib is derived from the vsclib. The rgalib and vgalib are\nsmall gate array type libraries.\n\nThe Alliance sxlib has also been characterised in 0.13\u00b5m using the\nsame methodology and converted to the same 0.13\u00b5m layout rules.\nThe characterisation methodology creates a web data book, and this\nis on-line with the cells' layout and schematics.\n",
