Doing this manually can be error prone, as it's easy to forget a\nfile, or miss that some unexpected file was added. This module simplifies\nmaintaining test directories by tracking their status as they are modified\nor tested with this API, making it simple to test both individual files, as\nwell as to verify that there are no missing or unknown files.\n",
