It works with any version control system that can export and import\ngit fast-import streams, including git, hg, fossil, bzr, CVS and RCS. It can\nalso read Subversion dump files directly and can thus be used to script\nproduction of very high-quality conversions from Subversion to any supported\nDVCS.\n",
