            "Description": "\nScoped search makes it easy to search your ActiveRecord-based models. It will\ncreate a named scope :search_for that can be called with a query string. It\nwill build an SQL query using the provided query string and a definition that\nspecifies on what fields to search. Because the functionality is built on\nnamed_scope, the result of the search_for call can be used like any other\nnamed_scope, so it can be chained with another scope or combined with\nwill_paginate. Because it uses standard SQL, it does not require any setup,\nindexers or daemons. This makes scoped_search suitable to quickly add basic\nsearch functionality to your application with little hassle. On the other hand,\nit may not be the best choice if it is going to be used on very large data sets\nor by a large user base.\n",
