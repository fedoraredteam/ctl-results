This\nprovides methods such as close() to end the session and sysread() to read data\ndirectly from the host, instead of via the waitfor() mechanism. Note that if\nyou do use sysread() directly when in telnet mode, you should probably pass\nthe output through preprocess() to extract telnet command sequences.\n",
