Think of it like\na file-based CMS, without all the complexity.  Jekyll takes your\ncontent, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a\ncomplete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or\nanother web server.  Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages,\nwhich you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.\nJekyll does what you tell it to do \u2014 no more, no less.  It doesn't\ntry to outsmart users by making bold assumptions, nor does it\nburden them with needless complexity and configuration.  Put simply,\nJekyll gets out of your way and allows you to concentrate on what\ntruly matters: your content.\n",
