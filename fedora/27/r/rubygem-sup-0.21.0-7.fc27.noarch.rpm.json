If you're the type of person who treats email as an\nextension of your long-term memory, Sup is for you.  Sup makes it easy to: -\nHandle massive amounts of email.  - Mix email from different sources: mbox\nfiles (even across different machines), Maildir directories, IMAP folders, POP\naccounts, and GMail accounts.  - Instantaneously search over your entire email\ncollection. Search over body text, or use a query language to combine search\npredicates in any way.  - Handle multiple accounts. Replying to email sent to\na particular account will use the correct SMTP server, signature, and from\naddress.  - Add custom code to handle certain types of messages or to handle\ncertain types of text within messages.  - Organize email with user-defined\nlabels, automatically track recent contacts, and much more!  The goal of Sup\nis to become the email client of choice for nerds everywhere.\n",
