            "Description": "\nApipie-rails is a DSL and Rails engine for documenting your RESTful API.\nInstead of traditional use of #comments, Apipie lets you describe the code,\nthrough the code. This brings advantages like:\n\n* No need to learn yet another syntax, you already know Ruby, right?\n* Possibility of reusing the docs for other purposes (such as validation)\n* Easier to extend and maintain (no string parsing involved)\n* Possibility of reusing other sources for documentation purposes (such as\n  routes etc.)\n\nThe documentation is available from within your app (by default under the\n/apipie path.) In development mode, you can see the changes as you go. It's\nmarkup language agnostic, and even provides an API for reusing the\ndocumentation data in JSON.\n",
