            "Description": "\n\nRapidJSON is a fast JSON parser and generator for C++.  It was\ninspired by RapidXml.\n\n  RapidJSON is small but complete.  It supports both SAX and DOM style\n  API. The SAX parser is only a half thousand lines of code.\n\n  RapidJSON is fast.  Its performance can be comparable to strlen().\n  It also optionally supports SSE2/SSE4.1 for acceleration.\n\n  RapidJSON is self-contained.  It does not depend on external\n  libraries such as BOOST.  It even does not depend on STL.\n\n  RapidJSON is memory friendly.  Each JSON value occupies exactly\n  16/20 bytes for most 32/64-bit machines (excluding text string).  By\n  default it uses a fast memory allocator, and the parser allocates\n  memory compactly during parsing.\n\n  RapidJSON is Unicode friendly.  It supports UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32\n  (LE & BE), and their detection, validation and transcoding\n  internally.  For example, you can read a UTF-8 file and let RapidJSON\n  transcode the JSON strings into UTF-16 in the DOM.  It also supports\n  surrogates and \"u0000\" (null character).\n\nJSON(JavaScript Object Notation) is a light-weight data exchange\nformat.  RapidJSON should be in fully compliance with RFC4627/ECMA-404.\n",
