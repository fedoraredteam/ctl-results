It exposes\nall the standard tree structure relations (ancestors, parent, root, children,\nsiblings, descendants) and all of them can be fetched in a single sql query.\nAdditional features are named_scopes, integrity checking, integrity restoration,\narrangement of (sub)tree into hashes and different strategies for dealing with\norphaned records.\n",
