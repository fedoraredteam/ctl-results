The module system provides a\ngreat flexibility that virtually allows support for any package with no user\nintervention, as well as pre- and post-processing of the document. The\nstandard modules currently provide support for bibtex, dvips, dvipdfm, pdftex,\nmakeindex. A good number of standard packages are supported, including\ngraphics/graphicx (with automatic conversion between various formats and\nMetapost compilation).\n",
