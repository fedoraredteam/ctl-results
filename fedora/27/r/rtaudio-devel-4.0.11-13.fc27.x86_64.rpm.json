RtAudio significantly\nsimplifies the process of interacting with computer audio hardware. It was\ndesigned with the following objectives:\n\n  * object-oriented C++ design\n  * simple, common API across all supported platforms\n  * allow simultaneous multi-api support\n  * support dynamic connection of devices\n  * provide extensive audio device parameter control\n  * allow audio device capability probing\n  * automatic internal conversion for data format, channel number compensation,\n    (de)interleaving, and byte-swapping\n",
