            "Description": "\nThis pure Ruby library can read and write PNG images without depending on\nan external image library, like RMagick. It tries to be memory efficient and\nreasonably fast.\nIt supports reading and writing all PNG variants that are defined in the\nspecification, with one limitation: only 8-bit color depth is supported. It\nsupports all transparency, interlacing and filtering options the PNG\nspecifications allows. It can also read and write textual metadata from PNG\nfiles. Low-level read/write access to PNG chunks is also possible.\nThis library supports simple drawing on the image canvas and simple operations\nlike alpha composition and cropping. Finally, it can import from and export to\nRMagick for interoperability.\n",
