            "Description": "\nThis is an automatic reloading version of the rackup command that's shipped\nwith Rack. It can be used as an alternative to the complex reloading logic\nprovided by web frameworks or in environments that don't support\napplication reloading.\n\nThe shotgun command starts one of Rack's supported servers (e.g., mongrel,\nthin, webrick) and listens for requests but does not load any part of the\nactual application. Each time a request is received, it forks, loads the\napplication in the child process, processes the request, and exits the\nchild process. The result is clean, application-wide reloading of all\nsource files and templates on each request.\n",
