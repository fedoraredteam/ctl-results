You would use either plugin / gem if you\nwished that when you called destroy on an Active Record object that it\ndidn't actually destroy it, but just \"hid\" the record. Paranoia does this\nby setting a deleted_at field to the current time when you destroy a record,\nand hides it by scoping all queries on your model to only include records\nwhich do not have a deleted_at field.\n",
