            "Description": "\nResque is a Redis-backed Ruby library for creating background jobs, placing\nthose jobs on multiple queues, and processing them later.  Background jobs\ncan be any Ruby class or module that responds to perform. Your existing\nclasses can easily be converted to background jobs or you can create new\nclasses specifically to do work. Or, you can do both.\nResque is heavily inspired by DelayedJob and is comprised of three parts:\n* A Ruby library for creating, querying, and processing jobs\n* A Rake task for starting a worker which processes jobs\n* A Sinatra app for monitoring queues, jobs, and workers.\n",
