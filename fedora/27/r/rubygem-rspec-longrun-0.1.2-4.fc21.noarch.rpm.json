But the default report formatters make it difficult\nto track progress of such long-running tests.\n\nThe RSpec::Longrun::Formatter outputs the name of each test as it starts,\nrather than waiting until it passes or fails.  It also provides a mechanism\nfor reporting on progress of a test while it is still executing.\n",
