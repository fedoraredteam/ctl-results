You can also call blocks as daemons and control\nthem from the parent or just daemonize the current process.  Besides this\nbasic functionality, daemons offers many advanced features like exception\nbacktracing and logging (in case your ruby script crashes) and monitoring and\nautomatic restarting of your processes if they crash.\n",
