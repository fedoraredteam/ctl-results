Its goal is to have the minimum interface possible, making it very\nstraightforward to use. Radio Tray is not a full featured music player,\nthere are plenty of excellent music players already. However, there was a\nneed for a simple application with minimal interface just to listen to online\nradios. And that's the sole purpose of Radio Tray.\n",
