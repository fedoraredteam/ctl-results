            "Description": "\nrtfilter provides a library written in C implementing realtime digital\nfiltering functions for multichannel signals (i.e. filtering multiple\nsignals with the same filter). It implements FIR, IIR filters and\ndownsampler for float and double data type (both for real and complex\nvalued signal). Additional functions are also provided to design few\nusual filters: Butterworth, Chebyshev, windowed sinc, analytical filter...\n\nOne of the main differences from other libraries providing digital signal\nprocessing is that the filter functions have been specifically designed and\noptimized for multichannel signals (from few channels to several hundred).\nIf data allows it, the library automatically switch to optimized SIMD\n(Single Instruction Multiple Data) code, allowing to reduce by 3~4 the time\nspent in processing the data.\n",
