            "Description": "\nColor is a Ruby library to provide basic RGB, CMYK, HSL, and other colourspace\nmanipulation support to applications that require it. It also provides 152\nnamed RGB colours (184 with spelling variations) that are commonly supported\nin HTML, SVG, and X11 applications. A technique for generating monochromatic\ncontrasting palettes is also included.\n\nThe Color library performs purely mathematical manipulation of the colours\nbased on colour theory without reference to colour profiles (such as sRGB or\nAdobe RGB). For most purposes, when working with RGB and HSL colour spaces,\nthis won't matter. Absolute colour spaces (like CIE L*a*b* and XYZ) and cannot\nbe reliably converted to relative colour spaces (like RGB) without colour\nprofiles.\n",
