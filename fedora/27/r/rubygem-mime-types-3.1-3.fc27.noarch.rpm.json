It can be used to determine defined filename\nextensions for MIME types, or to use filename extensions to look up the likely\nMIME type definitions.\nVersion 3.0 is a major release that requires Ruby 2.0 compatibility and\nremoves\ndeprecated functions. The columnar registry format introduced in 2.6 has been\nmade the primary format; the registry data has been extracted from this\nlibrary\nand put into {mime-types-data}[https://github.com/mime-types/mime-types-data].\nAdditionally, mime-types is now licensed exclusively under the MIT licence and\nthere is a code of conduct in effect. There are a number of other smaller\nchanges described in the History file.\n",
