Furthermore, it has a\ncomplete Perl API to create your own custom applications. EekBoek is\ndesigned for the Dutch/European market and currently available in\nDutch only. An English translation is in the works (help appreciated).\n\nEekBoek can make use of several database systems for its storage.\nSupport for the SQLite database is included.\n\nFor GUI support, install EekBoek-gui.\n\nFor production use, you are invited to install the EekBoek-db-postgresql\ndatabase package.\n",
