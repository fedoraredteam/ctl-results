ElectricFence uses the virtual memory hardware of your\nsystem to detect when software overruns malloc() buffer boundaries,\nand/or to detect any accesses of memory released by\nfree(). ElectricFence will then stop the program on the first\ninstruction that caused a bounds violation and you can use your\nfavorite debugger to display the offending statement.\n\nInstall ElectricFence if you need a debugger to find malloc()\nviolations.\n",
