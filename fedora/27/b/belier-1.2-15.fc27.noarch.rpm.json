The main feature of Belier is its ability to cross\nseveral intermediate computers before realizing the job.\n\n* Belier reaches the final computer through intermediate machines.\n* You can execute commands with any account available on the remote computer.\n* It is possible to switch account on intermediate computers before accessing\n  the final computer.\n* You can open a data tunnel through every host you cross to the final host.\n* Belier generates one script for each final computer to reach.\n",
