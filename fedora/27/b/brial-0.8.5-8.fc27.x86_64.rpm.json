            "Description": "\nThe core of BRiAl is a C++ library, which provides high-level data\ntypes for Boolean polynomials and monomials, exponent vectors, as well\nas for the underlying polynomial rings and subsets of the powerset of\nthe Boolean variables. As a unique approach, binary decision diagrams\nare used as internal storage type for polynomial structures. On top of\nthis C++-library we provide a Python interface. This allows parsing of\ncomplex polynomial systems, as well as sophisticated and extendable\nstrategies for Gr\u00f6bner base computation. BRiAL features a powerful\nreference implementation for Gr\u00f6bner basis computation.\n",
