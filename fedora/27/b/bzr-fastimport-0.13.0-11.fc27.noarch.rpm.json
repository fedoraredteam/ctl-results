It is designed to be used in combination with front-end programs\nthat generate a command/data stream for it to process. Front-ends are available\nfor a wide range of foreign VCS tools including Subversion, CVS, Git,\nMercurial, Darcs and Perforce. New front-ends are easy to develop in\nwhatever programming language you prefer, making Bazaar Fast Import useful\nfor teams needing a custom migration solution.\n",
