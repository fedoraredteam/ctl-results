            "Description": "\nBCC is a toolkit for creating efficient kernel tracing and manipulation\nprograms, and includes several useful tools and examples. It makes use of\nextended BPF (Berkeley Packet Filters), formally known as eBPF, a new feature\nthat was first added to Linux 3.15. BCC makes BPF programs easier to write,\nwith kernel instrumentation in C (and includes a C wrapper around LLVM), and\nfront-ends in Python and lua. It is suited for many tasks, including\nperformance analysis and network traffic control.\n",
