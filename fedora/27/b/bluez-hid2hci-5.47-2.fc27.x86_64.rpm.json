            "Description": "\nMost allinone PC's and bluetooth keyboard / mouse sets which include a\nbluetooth dongle, ship with a so called HID proxying bluetooth HCI.\nThe HID proxying makes the keyboard / mouse show up as regular USB HID\ndevices (after connecting using the connect button on the device + keyboard),\nwhich makes them work without requiring any manual configuration.\n\nThe bluez-hid2hci package contains the hid2hci utility and udev rules to\nautomatically switch supported Bluetooth devices into regular HCI mode.\n\nInstall this package if you want to use the bluetooth function of the HCI\nwith other bluetooth devices like for example a mobile phone.\n\nNote that after installing this package you will first need to pair your\nbluetooth keyboard and mouse with the bluetooth adapter before you can use\nthem again. Since you cannot use your bluetooth keyboard and mouse until\nthey are paired, this will require the use of a regular (wired) USB keyboard\nand mouse.\n",
