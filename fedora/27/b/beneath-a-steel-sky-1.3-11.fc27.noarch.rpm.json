            "Description": "\nAfter the Dungeons and Dragons fantasy setting of Revolution's first game, Lure\nof the Temptress, Revolution decided to go down a completely different avenue\nwith its second adventure game, Beneath a Steel Sky, that of Science Fiction.\nA bleak vision of the future was imagined, where mind control and medical\nscience combined forces to repress the populace. Leading comic artist, Dave\nGibbons, joined the design team to visualise this desperate landscape. The\nresult is the cult classic Beneath a Steel Sky.\n\nNotice that this package contains the floppy version, the CD version is also\navailable in the beneath-a-steel-sky-cd package. The CD version contains\nadditional / longer cutscenes and voice acting, but also is much larger: the CD\nversion ways in at 70 MB where as this version is only 8 MB.\n",
