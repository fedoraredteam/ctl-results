            "Description": "\nBean Scripting Framework (BSF) is a set of Java classes which provides\nscripting language support within Java applications, and access to Java\nobjects and methods from scripting languages. BSF allows one to write\nJSPs in languages other than Java while providing access to the Java\nclass library. In addition, BSF permits any Java application to be\nimplemented in part (or dynamically extended) by a language that is\nembedded within it. This is achieved by providing an API that permits\ncalling scripting language engines from within Java, as well as an\nobject registry that exposes Java objects to these scripting language\nengines.\n\nBSF supports several scripting languages currently:\n* Javascript (using Rhino ECMAScript, from the Mozilla project)\n* Python (using either Jython or JPython)\n* Tcl (using Jacl)\n* NetRexx (an extension of the IBM REXX scripting language in Java)\n* XSLT Stylesheets (as a component of Apache XML project's Xalan and\nXerces)\n\nIn addition, the following languages are supported with their own BSF\nengines:\n* Java (using BeanShell, from the BeanShell project)\n* JRuby\n* JudoScript\n",
