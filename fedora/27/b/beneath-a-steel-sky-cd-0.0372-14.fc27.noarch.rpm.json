            "Description": "\nAfter the Dungeons and Dragons fantasy setting of Revolution's first game, Lure\nof the Temptress, Revolution decided to go down a completely different avenue\nwith its second adventure game, Beneath a Steel Sky, that of Science Fiction.\nA bleak vision of the future was imagined, where mind control and medical\nscience combined forces to repress the populace. Leading comic artist, Dave\nGibbons, joined the design team to visualise this desperate landscape. The\nresult is the cult classic Beneath a Steel Sky.\n\nThis package contains the CD version, which contains additional / longer\ncutscenes and voice acting, but also is much larger: 70 MB where as the also\navailable floppy version (package name beneath-a-steel-sky) is only 8 MB.\n",
