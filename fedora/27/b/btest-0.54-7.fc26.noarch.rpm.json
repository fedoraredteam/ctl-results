Freely borrowing some\nideas from other packages, it\u2019s main objective is to provide an easy-to-use,\nstraightforward driver for a suite of shell-based tests. Each test consists\nof a set of command lines that will be executed, and success is determined\nbased on their exit codes. btest comes with some additional tools that can\nbe used within such tests to compare output against a previously established\nbaseline.\n",
