It uses LAN multicast in either a personal/small team mutual\nnavigation motif or in a classroom environment where there are Speakers plus\nthe Audience. It provides a complete yet minimal public interface to support\nmode setting, setup for packet reception, transmit on local navigation, and\nhandling of incoming packets.\n\nThis library is not specific to any particular Bible software framework,\ncompletely agnostic as to structure of layers above BibleSync.\n",
