Most programs you might use for making\nbackups don't have their own configuration file format. Backupninja provides\na centralized way to configure and schedule many different backup utilities.\n\nIt allows for secure, remote, incremental file system backup (via rdiff-backup),\ncompressed incremental data, backup system and hardware info, encrypted remote\nbackups (via duplicity), safe backup of MySQL/PostgreSQL databases, subversion\nor trac repositories, burn CD/DVDs or create ISOs, incremental rsync with\nhard-linking.\n",
