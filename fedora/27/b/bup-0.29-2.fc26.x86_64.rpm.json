            "Description": "\nVery efficient backup system based on the git packfile format, providing fast\nincremental saves and global deduplication (among and within files, including\nvirtual machine images). Some of its features are:\n* It uses a rolling checksum algorithm and hence it can backup huge files\n  incrementally.\n* It uses packfile format from git, so one can access the stored data even if\n  he doesn't like bup's user interface.\n* It writes packfiles directly so it is fast even with huge amounts of data:\n  it can track millions of files and keep track of hundreds or thousands of\n  gigabytes of objects.\n* Data is \"automagically\" shared between incremental backups without having to\n  know which backup is based on which other one.\n* One can make a backup directly to a remote bup server, without needing tons\n  of temporary disk space on the computer being backed up. If the backup is\n  interrupted halfway through, the next run will pick up where the previous\n  backup left off.\n* It can use \"par2\" redundancy to recover corrupted backups even if the disk\n  has undetected bad sectors.\n* Each incremental backup acts as if it's a full backup, it just takes less\n  disk space.\n* One can mount a bup repository as a FUSE filesystem and access the contents\n  that way, or even export it over Samba.\n",
