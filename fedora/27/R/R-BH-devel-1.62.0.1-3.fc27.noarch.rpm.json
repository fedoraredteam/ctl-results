A large part\nof Boost is provided as C++ template code which is resolved entirely at\ncompile-time without linking. This package aims to provide the most useful\nsubset of Boost libraries for template use among CRAN package. By placing\nthese libraries in this package, we offer a more efficient distribution\nsystem for CRAN as replication of this code in the sources of other packages\nis avoided.\n",
