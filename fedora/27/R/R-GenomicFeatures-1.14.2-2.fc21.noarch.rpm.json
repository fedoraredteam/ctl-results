With these tools the user can easily download the genomic\nlocations of the transcripts, exons and cds of a given organism, from either\nthe UCSC Genome Browser or a BioMart database (more sources will be supported\nin the future). This information is then stored in a local database that\nkeeps track of the relationship between transcripts, exons, cds and genes.\nFlexible methods are provided for extracting the desired features in a\nconvenient format.\n",
