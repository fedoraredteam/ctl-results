            "Description": "\nA language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.\nR is similar to the award-winning S system, which was developed at\nBell Laboratories by John Chambers et al. It provides a wide\nvariety of statistical and graphical techniques (linear and\nnonlinear modelling, statistical tests, time series analysis,\nclassification, clustering, ...).\n\nR is designed as a true computer language with control-flow\nconstructions for iteration and alternation, and it allows users to\nadd additional functionality by defining new functions. For\ncomputationally intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked\nand called at run time.\n\nThis package also has an additional dependency on java, as provided by\nFedora's openJDK.\n",
