Single-step and\nstep-wise methods are implemented. Tests based on a variety of t- and\nF-statistics (including t-statistics based on regression parameters from\nlinear and survival models) are included. Results are reported in terms\nof adjusted p-values, confindence regions and test statistic cutoffs.\nThe procedures are directly applicable to identifying differentially\nexpressed genes in DNA microarray experiments.\n\nThis Library is a part of the Bioconductor (bioconductor.org) proejct.\n",
