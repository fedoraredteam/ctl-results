            "Description": "\nRandom123 is a library of \"counter-based\" random number generators (CBRNGs), in\nwhich the Nth random number can be obtained by applying a stateless mixing\nfunction to N instead of the conventional approach of using N iterations of a\nstateful transformation. CBRNGs were originally developed for use in MD\napplications on Anton, but they are ideal for a wide range of applications on\nmodern multi-core CPUs, GPUs, clusters, and special-purpose hardware. Three\nfamilies of non-cryptographic CBRNGs are described in a paper presented at the\nSC11 conference: ARS (based on the Advanced Encryption System (AES)), Threefry\n(based on the Threefish encryption function), and Philox (based on integer\nmultiplication). They all satisfy rigorous statistical testing (passing\nBigCrush in TestU01), vectorize and parallelize well (each generator can\nproduce at least 264 independent streams), have long periods (the period of\neach stream is at least 2128), require little or no memory or state, and have\nexcellent performance (a few clock cycles per byte of random output). The\nRandom123 library can be used with CPU (C and C++) and GPU (CUDA and OpenCL)\napplications.\n",
