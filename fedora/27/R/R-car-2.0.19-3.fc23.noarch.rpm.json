The package contains mostly functions for applied\nregression, linear models, and generalized linear models, with an emphasis on\nregression diagnostics, particularly graphical diagnostic methods.  There are\nalso some utility functions. With some exceptions, it does not duplicate\ncapabilities in the basic distribution of R, nor in widely used packages.\nWhere relevant, the functions in car are consistent with na.action = na.omit\nor na.exclude.\n",
