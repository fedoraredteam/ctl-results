            "Description": "\nImplementation of a function 'digest()' for the creation of hash digests of\narbitrary R objects (using the md5, sha-1, sha-256, crc32, xxhash and\nmurmurhash algorithms) permitting easy comparison of R language objects, as\nwell as a function 'hmac()' to create hash-based message authentication code.\nThe md5 algorithm by Ron Rivest is specified in RFC 1321, the sha-1 and\nsha-256 algorithms are specified in FIPS-180-1 and FIPS-180-2, and the crc32\nalgorithm is described in\nftp://ftp.rocksoft.com/cliens/rocksoft/papers/crc_v3.txt. For md5, sha-1,\nsha-256 and aes, this package uses small standalone implementations that were\nprovided by Christophe Devine. For crc32, code from the zlib library is used.\nFor sha-512, an implementation by Aaron D. Gifford is used. For xxHash, the\nimplementation by Yann Collet is used. For murmurhash, an implementation by\nShane Day is used. Please note that this package is not meant to be deployed\nfor cryptographic purposes for which more comprehensive (and widely tested)\nlibraries such as OpenSSL should be used.\n",
