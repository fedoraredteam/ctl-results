            "Description": "\nIt takes a list of p-values resulting from the simultaneous\ntesting of many hypotheses and estimates their q-values.\nThe q-value of a test measures the proportion of false positives\nincurred (called the false discovery rate) when that particular\ntest is called significant. Various plots are automatically\ngenerated, allowing one to make sensible significance cut-offs.\nSeveral mathematical results have recently been shown on the\nconservative accuracy of the estimated q-values from this software.\nThe software can be applied to problems in genomics, brain imaging,\nastrophysics, and data mining.\n\nThis package is a part of the Bioconductor (bioconductor.org) project.\n",
