            "Description": "\nIn recent years a wealth of biological data has become available in public\ndata repositories. Easy access to these valuable data resources and firm\nintegration with data analysis is needed for comprehensive bioinformatics data\nanalysis. biomaRt provides an interface to a growing collection of databases\nimplementing the BioMart software suite (http://www.biomart.org). The package\nenables retrieval of large amounts of data in a uniform way without the need\nto know the underlying database schemas or write complex SQL queries. Examples\nof BioMart databases are Ensembl, COSMIC, Uniprot, HGNC, Gramene, Wormbase and\ndbSNP mapped to Ensembl. These major databases give biomaRt users direct\naccess to a diverse set of data and enable a wide range of powerful online\nqueries from gene annotation to database mining.\n",
