Since it uses the same back-end for\nall output, copying across formats is WYSIWYG. Files are created without\nthe dependence on X11 or other external programs. This device supports\nalpha channel (semi-transparent drawing) and resulting images can contain\ntransparent and semi-transparent regions. It is ideal for use in server\nenvironments (file output) and as a replacement for other devices that\ndon't have Cairo's capabilities such as alpha support or anti-aliasing.\nBackends are modular such that any subset of backends is supported.\n",
