Many R data types and\nobjects can be mapped back and forth to C++ equivalents which\nfacilitates both writing of new code as well as easier integration of\nthird-party libraries.\nDocumentation about Rcpp is provided by several vignettes included in\nthis package, via the Rcpp Gallery site at http://gallery.rcpp.org,\nthe paper by Eddelbuettel and Francois (2011, JSS), and the book by\nEddelbuettel (2013, Springer).\nSee citation(\"Rcpp\") for details on the last two.\n",
