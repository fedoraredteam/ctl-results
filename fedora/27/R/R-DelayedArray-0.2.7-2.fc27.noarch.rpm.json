            "Description": "\nWrapping an array-like object (typically an on-disk object) in a DelayedArray\nobject allows one to perform common array operations on it without loading\nthe object in memory. In order to reduce memory usage and optimize\nperformance, operations on the object are either delayed or executed using a\nblock processing mechanism. Note that this also works on in-memory array-like\nobjects like DataFrame objects (typically with Rle columns), Matrix objects,\nand ordinary arrays and data frames.\n",
