            "Description": "\nR-qtl is an extensible, interactive environment for mapping\nquantitative trait loci (QTLs) in experimental crosses. Our goal is to\nmake complex QTL mapping methods widely accessible and allow users to\nfocus on modeling rather than computing.\n\nA key component of computational methods for QTL mapping is the hidden\nMarkov model (HMM) technology for dealing with missing genotype\ndata. We have implemented the main HMM algorithms, with allowance for\nthe presence of genotyping errors, for backcrosses, intercrosses, and\nphase-known four-way crosses.\n\nThe current version of R-qtl includes facilities for estimating\ngenetic maps, identifying genotyping errors, and performing single-QTL\ngenome scans and two-QTL, two-dimensional genome scans, by interval\nmapping (with the EM algorithm), Haley-Knott regression, and multiple\nimputation. All of this may be done in the presence of covariates\n(such as sex, age or treatment). One may also fit higher-order QTL\nmodels by multiple imputation and Haley-Knott regression.\n",
