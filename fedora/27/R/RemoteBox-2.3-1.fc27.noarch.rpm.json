            "Description": "\nVirtualBox is traditionally considered to be a virtualization solution aimed\nat the desktop as opposed to other solutions such as KVM, Xen and VMWare ESX\nwhich are considered more server oriented solutions. While it is certainly\npossible to install VirtualBox on a server, it offers few remote management\nfeatures beyond using the vboxmanage command line. RemoteBox aims to fill\nthis gap by providing a graphical VirtualBox client which is able to\ncommunicate with and manage a VirtualBox server installation.\n\nRemoteBox achieves this by using the vboxwebsrv feature of VirtualBox that\nallows its API to be accessed using a protocol called SOAP, even across a\nnetwork. RemoteBox is very similar in look and feel to the native VirtualBox\ninterface and allows you to perform most of the same tasks, including\naccessing the display of guests \u2013 completely remotely.\n",
