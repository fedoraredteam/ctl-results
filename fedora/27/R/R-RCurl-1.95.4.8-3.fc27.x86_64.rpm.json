This provides a great deal of control over the\nHTTP/FTP/... connection and the form of the request while providing a\nhigher-level interface than is available just using R socket connections.\nAdditionally, the underlying implementation is robust and extensive, supporting\nFTP/FTPS/TFTP (uploads and downloads), SSL/HTTPS, telnet, dict, ldap, and also\nsupports cookies, redirects, authentication, etc.\n",
