The core of the package\nimplements a framework for performing fully customized requests where data\ncan be processed either in memory, on disk, or streaming via the callback\nor connection interfaces. Some knowledge of 'libcurl' is recommended; for\na more-user-friendly web client see the 'httr' package which builds on\nthis package with http specific tools and logic.\n",
