            "Description": "\nLiblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator named in\nhonor of Louis Braille. It features support for computer and literary braille,\nsupports contracted and uncontracted translation for many languages and has\nsupport for hyphenation. New languages can easily be added through tables that\nsupport a rule- or dictionary based approach. Liblouis also supports math\nbraille (Nemeth and Marburg).\n\nLiblouis has features to support screen-reading programs. This has led to its\nuse in two open-source screen readers, NVDA and Orca. It is also used in some\ncommercial assistive technology applications for example by ViewPlus.\n\nLiblouis is based on the translation routines in the BRLTTY screen reader for\nLinux. It has, however, gone far beyond these routines.\n",
