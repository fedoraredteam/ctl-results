            "Description": "\nfplll contains several algorithms on lattices that rely on\nfloating-point computations. This includes implementations of the\nfloating-point LLL reduction algorithm, offering different\nspeed/guarantees ratios. It contains a 'wrapper' choosing the\nestimated best sequence of variants in order to provide a guaranteed\noutput as fast as possible. In the case of the wrapper, the\nsuccession of variants is oblivious to the user. It also includes\na rigorous floating-point implementation of the Kannan-Fincke-Pohst\nalgorithm that finds a shortest non-zero lattice vector, and the BKZ\nreduction algorithm.\n",
