It is not an application itself (though it does come with\nexample programs), but rather a library you can embed in other\napplications.\n\nLibSBML 5.15.0 understands SBML Level 3 Version 1 and older,\nas well as the draft SBML Level 2 Layout proposal by Gauges, Rost,\nSahle and Wegner.  It\u2019s written in ISO C and C++ but can also be\nused from C#, Java, MATLAB, Octave, PERL, Python, and Ruby.\n",
