            "Description": "\nHubbub is an HTML5 compliant parsing library, written in C. It was\ndeveloped as part of the NetSurf project.\n\nThe HTML5 specification defines a parsing algorithm, based on the\nbehavior of mainstream browsers, which provides instructions for how to\nparse all markup, both valid and invalid. As a result, Hubbub parses web\ncontent well.\n\nFeatures:\n* Parses HTML, good and bad\n* Simple C API\n* Fast\n* Character encoding detection\n* Well-tested (~90% test coverage)\n* Portable\n",
