            "Description": "\nlightdm-autologin-greeter is a minimal greeter for LightDM that has\nthe same autologin behavior as nodm, but being based on LightDM,\nit stays on top of modern display manager requirements.\n\nThe difference between LightDM's built-in autologin and this greeter,\nis the behavior in case of 0-seconds autologin delay. When LightDM\nautomatically logs in with no delay, upon logout it will show the\nlogin window again. The intent is that if the default user logged out,\nthey probably intend to log in again as a different user.\n\nIn the case of managing a kiosk-like setup, if the X session quits, then\nthe desired behavior is to just start it again.\n\nLightDM with an autologin timeout of 1 or more seconds would work,\nbut one sees the login dialog window appear and disappear\non-screen at each system startup.\n\nWith this greeter, the X session starts right away, and is restarted\nif it quits, without any flicker of a login dialog box.\n\nIf one is not setting up a kiosk-like setup, it's very likely that the\ndefault autologin behavior of LightDM is the way to go, and that this\ngreeter is not needed.\n",
