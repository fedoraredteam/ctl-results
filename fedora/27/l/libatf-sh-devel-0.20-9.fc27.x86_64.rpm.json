            "Description": "\nThe Automated Testing Framework (ATF) is a collection of libraries to\nimplement test programs in a variety of languages.  At the moment, ATF\noffers C, C++ and POSIX shell bindings with which to implement tests.\nThese bindings all offer a similar set of functionality and any test\nprogram written with them exposes a consistent user interface.\n\nATF-based test programs rely on a separate runtime engine to execute them.\nThe runtime engine is in charge of isolating the test programs from the\nrest of the system to ensure that their results are deterministic and that\nthey cannot affect the running system.  The runtime engine is also\nresponsible for gathering the results of all tests and composing reports.\nThe current runtime of choice is Kyua.\n\nThis package provides the supporting files and documentation to develop\napplications that use the ATF POSIX shell bindings.\n",
