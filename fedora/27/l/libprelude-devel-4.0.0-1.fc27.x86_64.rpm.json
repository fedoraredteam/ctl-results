Libprelude is a collection of generic functions providing\ncommunication between all Sensors, like IDS (Intrusion Detection System),\nand the Prelude Manager. It provides a convenient interface for sending and\nreceiving IDMEF (Information and Event Message Exchange Format) alerts to\nPrelude Manager with transparent SSL, fail-over and replication support,\nasynchronous events and timer interfaces, an abstracted configuration API\n(hooking at the command-line, the configuration line, or wide configuration,\navailable from the Manager), and a generic plugin API. It allows you to easily\nturn your favorite security program into a Prelude sensor.\n",
