A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both\nspace and time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs.  A UUID can\nbe used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely\nshort lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects\nacross a network.\n\nSee also the \"uuid\" package, which is a separate implementation.\n",
