            "Description": "\nLibburn is a library by which preformatted data get onto optical media:\nCD, DVD and BD (Blu-Ray). It also offers a facility for reading data\nblocks from its drives without using the normal block device I/O, which\nhas advantages and disadvantages. It seems appropriate, nevertheless,\nto do writing and reading via same channel. On several Linux systems,\nthe block device driver needs reloading of the drive tray in order to\nmake available freshly written data. The libburn read function does not\nneed such a reload. The code of libburn is independent of cdrecord.\n",
