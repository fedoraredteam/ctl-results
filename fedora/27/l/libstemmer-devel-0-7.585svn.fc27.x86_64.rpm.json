            "Description": "\nThis package contains development files of libstemmer.\n\nSnowball stemming algorithms for use in Information Retrieval Snowball\nprovides access to efficient algorithms for calculating a \"stemmed\"\nform of a word.  This is a form with most of the common morphological\nendings removed; hopefully representing a common linguistic base form.\nThis is most useful in building search engines and information\nretrieval software; for example, a search with stemming enabled should\nbe able to find a document containing \"cycling\" given the query\n\"cycles\".\n\nSnowball provides algorithms for several (mainly European) languages.\nIt also provides access to the classic Porter stemming algorithm for\nEnglish: although this has been superseded by an improved algorithm,\nthe original algorithm may be of interest to information retrieval\nresearchers wishing to reproduce results of earlier experiments.\n",
