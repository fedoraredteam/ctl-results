There is also a Visual C++ project file for building\n      under Windows.\n\n    * Input and output signals are in memory (as opposed to sound\n      files).\n\n    * Computations are in floating-point (instead of fixed-point).\n\n    * Filter table increased by a factor of 32, yielding more accurate\n      results, even without linear interpolation (which also makes it\n      faster).\n\n    * Data can be processed in small chunks, enabling time-varying\n      resampling ratios (ideal for time-warping applications and\n      supporting an ``external clock input'' in software).\n\n    * Easily applied to any number of simultaneous data channels\n",
