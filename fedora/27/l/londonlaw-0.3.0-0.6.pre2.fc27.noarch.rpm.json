            "Description": "\nLondon Law is an online multiplayer version of a well known detective\nboardgame. The game is unusually asymmetric; one player controls the movements\nof the criminal Mr. X as he tries to evade the detectives, while another one to\nfive players control five detectives trying to track him down. Mr. X has an\nadvantage in access to transportation routes, and his precise location remains\nhidden for most of the game. The detectives have only the advantage of superior\nnumbers, so they must work in concert to limit the criminal's options. London\nLaw features an attractive map overlaid on high-resolution satellite imagery.\n",
