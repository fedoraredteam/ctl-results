            "Description": "\nlibclc is an open source, BSD licensed implementation of the library\nrequirements of the OpenCL C programming language, as specified by the\nOpenCL 1.1 Specification. The following sections of the specification\nimpose library requirements:\n\n  * 6.1: Supported Data Types\n  * 6.2.3: Explicit Conversions\n  * 6.2.4.2: Reinterpreting Types Using as_type() and as_typen()\n  * 6.9: Preprocessor Directives and Macros\n  * 6.11: Built-in Functions\n  * 9.3: Double Precision Floating-Point\n  * 9.4: 64-bit Atomics\n  * 9.5: Writing to 3D image memory objects\n  * 9.6: Half Precision Floating-Point\n\nlibclc is intended to be used with the Clang compiler's OpenCL frontend.\n\nlibclc is designed to be portable and extensible. To this end, it provides\ngeneric implementations of most library requirements, allowing the target\nto override the generic implementation at the granularity of individual\nfunctions.\n\nlibclc currently only supports the PTX target, but support for more\ntargets is welcome.\n",
