            "Description": "\nThe libpmemlog library provides a pmem-resident log file. This\nlibrary is provided for cases requiring an append-mostly file to\nrecord variable length entries. Most developers will find higher\nlevel libraries like libpmemobj to be more generally useful.\n\nThis sub-package contains debug variant of the library, providing\nrun-time assertions and trace points. The typical way to access the\ndebug version is to set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to\n/usr/lib64/nvml_debug.\n",
