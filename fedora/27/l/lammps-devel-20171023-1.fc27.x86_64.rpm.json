            "Description": "\nLAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics code, and an acronym for Large-scale\nAtomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator.\n\nLAMMPS has potentials for soft materials (biomolecules, polymers) and\nsolid-state materials (metals, semiconductors) and coarse-grained or\nmesoscopic systems. It can be used to model atoms or, more generically, as a\nparallel particle simulator at the atomic, meso, or continuum scale.\n\nLAMMPS runs on single processors or in parallel using message-passing\ntechniques and a spatial-decomposition of the simulation domain. The code is\ndesigned to be easy to modify or extend with new functionality.\n\nThis package contains development libraries for serial LAMMPS.\n",
