It provides\ntools, APIs, and library support that allow you to persist C++ objects\nto a relational database (RDBMS) without having to deal with tables,\ncolumns, or SQL and without manually writing any of the mapping code.\n\nThis package contains the common ODB runtime library. Every application\nthat includes code generated by the ODB compiler will need to link to\nthis library.\n",
