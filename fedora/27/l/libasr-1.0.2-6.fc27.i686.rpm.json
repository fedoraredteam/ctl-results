            "Description": "\nLibasr allows to run DNS queries and perform hostname resolutions in a fully\nasynchronous fashion. The implementation is thread-less, fork-less, and does not\nmake use of signals or other \"tricks\" that might get in the developer's way.\nThe API was initially developed for the OpenBSD operating system, where it is\nnatively supported.\n\nThis library is intended to bring this interface to other systems. It is\noriginally provided as a support library for the portable version of the\nOpenSMTPD daemon, but it can be used in any other contexts.\n",
