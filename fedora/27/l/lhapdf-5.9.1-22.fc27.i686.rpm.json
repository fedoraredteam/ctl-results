            "Description": "\nLHAPDF provides a unified and easy to use interface to modern PDF\nsets. It is designed to work not only with individual PDF sets but\nalso with the more recent multiple \"error\" sets. It can be viewed as\nthe successor to PDFLIB, incorporating many of the older sets found in\nthe latter, including pion and photon PDFs. In LHAPDF the computer\ncode and input parameters/grids are separated thus allowing more easy\nupdating and no limit to the expansion possibilities.\n",
