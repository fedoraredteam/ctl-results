It was written because the official CBS Interactive Last.fm library\nrequires Nokia QT, which is usually not desired when using GTK+ based distros.\n\nThis library supports much more than basic scrobble submission. You can send\nshouts, fetch Album covers and much more.\n\nDue to the naming conflict with the official last.fm library, this library will\ninstall as \"libclastfm\".\n",
