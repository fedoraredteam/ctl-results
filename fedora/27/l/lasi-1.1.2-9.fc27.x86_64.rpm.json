            "Description": "\nLASi is a library written by Larry Siden  that provides a C++ stream output\ninterface ( with operator << ) for creating Postscript documents that can\ncontain characters from any of the scripts and symbol blocks supported in\nUnicode  and by Owen Taylor's Pango layout engine. The library accommodates\nright-to-left scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew as easily as left-to-right\nscripts. Indic and Indic-derived Complex Text Layout (CTL) scripts, such as\nDevanagari, Thai, Lao, and Tibetan are supported to the extent provided by\nPango and by the OpenType fonts installed on your system. All of this is\nprovided without need for any special configuration or layout calculation on\nthe programmer's part.\n\nAlthough the capability to produce Unicode-based multilingual Postscript\ndocuments exists in large Open Source application framework libraries such as\nGTK+, QT, and KDE, LASi was designed for projects which require the ability\nto produce Postscript independent of any one application framework.\n",
