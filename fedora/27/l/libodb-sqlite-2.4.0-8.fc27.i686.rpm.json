It provides\ntools, APIs, and library support that allow you to persist C++ objects\nto a relational database (RDBMS) without having to deal with tables,\ncolumns, or SQL and without manually writing any of the mapping code.\n\nThis package contains the SQLite ODB runtime library. Every application\nthat includes code generated for the SQLite database will need to link\nto this library.\n",
