ICU supports the most current version of the Unicode\nstandard, and they provide support for supplementary Unicode\ncharacters (needed for GB 18030 repertoire support).\nAs computing environments become more heterogeneous, software\nportability becomes more important. ICU lets you produce the same\nresults across all the various platforms you support, without\nsacrificing performance. It offers great flexibility to extend and\ncustomize the supplied services.\n",
