            "Description": "\nLAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) is a standard library for numerical\nlinear algebra. LAPACK provides routines for solving systems of\nsimultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions of linear\nsystems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular value\nproblems. Associated matrix factorizations (LU, Cholesky, QR, SVD,\nSchur, and generalized Schur) and related computations (i.e.,\nreordering of Schur factorizations and estimating condition numbers)\nare also included. LAPACK can handle dense and banded matrices, but\nnot general sparse matrices. Similar functionality is provided for\nreal and complex matrices in both single and double precision. LAPACK\nis coded in Fortran90 and built with gcc.\n",
