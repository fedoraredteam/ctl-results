            "Description": "\nIxion is a general purpose formula parser & interpreter that can calculate\nmultiple named targets, or \"cells\".\n\nThe goal of this project is to create a library for calculating the results of\nformula expressions stored in multiple named targets, or \u201ccells\u201d. The cells can\nbe referenced from each other, and the library takes care of resolving their\ndependencies automatically upon calculation. The caller can run the calculation\nroutine either in a single-threaded mode, or a multi-threaded mode. The library\nalso supports re-calculations where the contents of one or more cells have been\nmodified since the last calculation, and a partial calculation of only the\naffected cells need to be calculated.\n\nSupported features:\n- Each calculation session is defined in a plain text file, which is parsed and\n  interpreted by the Ixion parser.\n- Fully threaded calculation.\n- Name resolution using A1-style references.\n- Support 2D cell references and named expressions.\n- Support range references.\n- Dependency tracking during both full calculation and partial re-calculation.\n- Inline strings.\n- Volatile functions. The framework for volatile functions is implemented. We\n  just need to implement more functions.\n",
