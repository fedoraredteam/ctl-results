            "Description": "\nCompilers for high level languages generate code that follow certain\nconventions.  These conventions are necessary, in part, for separate\ncompilation to work.  One such convention is the \"calling convention\".\nThe calling convention is a set of assumptions made by the compiler\nabout where function arguments will be found on entry to a function.  A\ncalling convention also specifies where the return value for a function\nis found.\n\nSome programs may not know at the time of compilation what arguments\nare to be passed to a function.  For instance, an interpreter may be\ntold at run-time about the number and types of arguments used to call a\ngiven function.  `Libffi' can be used in such programs to provide a\nbridge from the interpreter program to compiled code.\n\nThe `libffi' library provides a portable, high level programming\ninterface to various calling conventions.  This allows a programmer to\ncall any function specified by a call interface description at run time.\n\nFFI stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function\ninterface is the popular name for the interface that allows code\nwritten in one language to call code written in another language.  The\n`libffi' library really only provides the lowest, machine dependent\nlayer of a fully featured foreign function interface.  A layer must\nexist above `libffi' that handles type conversions for values passed\nbetween the two languages.\n",
