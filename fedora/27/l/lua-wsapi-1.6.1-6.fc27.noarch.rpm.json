            "Description": "\nWSAPI is an API that abstracts the web server from Lua web applications. By\ncoding against WSAPI your application can run on any of the supported servers\nand interfaces (currently CGI, FastCGI and Xavante, on Windows and UNIX-based\nsystems).\n\nWSAPI provides a set of helper libraries that help with request processing\nand output buffering. You can also write applications that act as filters that\nprovide some kind of service to other applications, such as authentication,\nfile uploads, request isolation, or multiplexing.\n\nWSAPI's main influence is Ruby's Rack framework, but it was also influenced by\nPython's WSGI (PEP 333). It's not a direct clone of either of them, though,\nand tries to follow standard Lua idioms.\n",
