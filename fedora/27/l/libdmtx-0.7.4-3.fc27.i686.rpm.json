At its core\nlibdmtx is a shared library, allowing C/C++ programs to use its capabilities\nwithout restrictions or overhead.\n\nThe included utility programs, dmtxread and dmtxwrite, provide the official\ninterface to libdmtx from the command line, and also serve as a good reference\nfor programmers who wish to write their own programs that interact with\nlibdmtx. All of the software in the libdmtx package is distributed under\nthe LGPLv2 and can be used freely under these terms.\n",
