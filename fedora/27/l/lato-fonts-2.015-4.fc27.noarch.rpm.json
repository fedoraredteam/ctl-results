            "Description": "\nLato is a sanserif typeface family designed in the Summer 2010 by Warsaw-based\ndesigner \u0141ukasz Dziedzic (\"Lato\" means \"Summer\" in Polish). In December 2010 the\nLato family was published under the open-source Open Font License by his foundry\ntyPoland, with support from Google.\n\nWhen working on Lato, \u0141ukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially\nconflicting priorities. He wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite\n\"transparent\" when used in body text but would display some original treats when\nused in larger sizes. He used classical proportions (particularly visible in the\nuppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same\ntime, he created a sleek sanserif look, which makes evident the fact that Lato\nwas designed in 2010 - even though it does not follow any current trend.\n\nThe semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the\nstrong structure provides stability and seriousness. \"Male and female, serious\nbut friendly. With the feeling of the Summer,\" says \u0141ukasz.\n\nLato consists of nine weights (plus corresponding italics), including a\nbeautiful hairline style. It covers 2300+ glyphs per style and supports 100+\nLatin-based languages, 50+ Cyrillic-based languages as well as Greek and IPA\nphonetics.\n",
