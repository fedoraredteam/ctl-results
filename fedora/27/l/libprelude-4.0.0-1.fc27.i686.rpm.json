It provides a convenient interface for sending and receiving IDMEF\n(Information and Event Message Exchange Format) alerts to Prelude Manager with\ntransparent SSL, fail-over and replication support, asynchronous events and\ntimer interfaces, an abstracted configuration API (hooking at the command-line,\nthe configuration line, or wide configuration, available from the Manager), and\na generic plugin API. It allows you to easily turn your favorite security\nprogram into a Prelude sensor.\n",
