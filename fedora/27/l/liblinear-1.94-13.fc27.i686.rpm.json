It\nprovides easy-to-use command-line tools and library calls for users and\ndevelopers.  Comprehensive documents are available for both beginners\nand advanced users.\n\nExperiments demonstrate that liblinear is very efficient on large sparse\ndata sets.  liblinear is the winner of ICML 2008 large-scale learning\nchallenge (linear SVM track).  It is also used for winning KDD Cup 2010.\n",
