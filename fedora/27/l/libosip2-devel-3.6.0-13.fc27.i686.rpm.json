            "Description": "\nThe GNU oSIP library is written in C and get no dependencies except the\nstandard C library. oSIP is thread safe and will generally be used in a\nmulti-threaded application. Nevertheless, this is optional.\n\noSIP is little in size and code and thus could be use to implement IP\nsoft-phone as well as embedded SIP software. oSIP is not limited to endpoint\nagents, and can also be used to implement \"SIP proxy\".\n\noSIP does not intend to provide a high layer API for controlling \"SIP Session\"\nat this step. Instead, it currently provides an API for the SIP message parser,\nSDP message parser, and library to handle \"SIP transactions\" as defined by the\nSIP document.\n",
