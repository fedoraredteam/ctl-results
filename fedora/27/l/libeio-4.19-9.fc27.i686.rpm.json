Features include: asynchronous read,\nwrite, open, close, stat, unlink, fdatasync, mknod, readdir etc. (basically\nthe full POSIX API). sendfile (native on Solaris, Linux, HP-UX, FreeBSD,\nemulated everywhere else), readahead (emulated where not available).\n\nIt is fully event-library agnostic and can easily be integrated into any\nevent-library (or used standalone, even in polling mode). It is very portable\nand relies only on POSIX threads.\n",
