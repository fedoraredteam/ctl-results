            "Description": "\nLibisoburn is a front-end for libraries libburn and libisofs which\nenables creation and expansion of ISO-9660 filesystems on all CD/\nDVD/BD media supported by libburn. This includes media like DVD+RW,\nwhich do not support multi-session management on media level and\neven plain disk files or block devices. Price for that is thorough\nspecialization on data files in ISO-9660 filesystem images. And so\nlibisoburn is not suitable for audio (CD-DA) or any other CD layout\nwhich does not entirely consist of ISO-9660 sessions.\n",
