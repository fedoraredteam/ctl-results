Originally part of the Gtk--\nwidget set, libsigc++ is now a separate library to provide for more general\nuse. It is the most complete library of its kind with the ablity to connect\nan abstract callback to a class method, function, or function object. It\ncontains adaptor classes for connection of dissimilar callbacks and has an\nease of use unmatched by other C++ callback libraries.\n\nPackage gtkmm (previously gtk--), which is a C++ binding to the GTK+\nlibrary, starting with version 1.1.2, uses libsigc++.\n",
