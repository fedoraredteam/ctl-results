The library\nuses memory files as file abstraction to achieve both performance and\nportability. For binary files, LibXDiff implements both (with some\nmodification) the algorithm described in File System Support for Delta\nCompression by Joshua P. MacDonald, and the algorithm described in\nFingerprinting By Random Polynomials by Michael O. Rabin. While for text\nfiles it follows directives described in An O(ND) Difference Algorithm\nand Its Variations by Eugene W. Myers.\n\nThis is a merged fork of the forks of the original libxdiff (0.23) found\nin the git and libgit2 source code, converted into a shared library.\n",
