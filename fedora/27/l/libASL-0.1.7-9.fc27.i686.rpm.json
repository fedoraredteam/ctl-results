            "Description": "\nAdvanced Simulation Library (ASL) is a free and open source hardware\naccelerated multiphysics simulation platform (and an extensible general\npurpose tool for solving Partial Differential Equations). Its\ncomputational engine is written in OpenCL and utilizes matrix-free\nsolution techniques which enable extraordinarily high performance,\nmemory efficiency and deployability on a variety of massively parallel\narchitectures, ranging from inexpensive FPGAs, DSPs and GPUs up to\nheterogeneous clusters and supercomputers. The engine is hidden entirely\nbehind simple C++ classes, so that no OpenCL knowledge is required from\napplication programmers. Mesh-free, immersed boundary approach allows to\nmove from CAD directly to simulation drastically reducing pre-processing\nefforts and amount of potential errors. ASL can be used to model various\ncoupled physical and chemical phenomena and employed in a multitude of\nfields: computational fluid dynamics, virtual sensing, industrial\nprocess data validation and reconciliation, image-guided surgery,\ncomputer-aided engineering, design space exploration, crystallography,\netc..\n",
