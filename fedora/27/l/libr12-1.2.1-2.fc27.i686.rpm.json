All linear R12 methods, such as MP2-R12, contain\nterms in the wave function that are linear in the inter-electronic distances\nr_{ij} (hence the name). Appearance of several types of two-body integrals is\ndue to the use of the approximate resolution of the identity to reduce three-\nand four-body integrals to products of simpler integrals.\n",
