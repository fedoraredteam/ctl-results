It provides a portable and simplified\ninterface for low-level network packet shaping, handling and injection. Libnet\nhides much of the tedium of packet creation from the application programmer\nsuch as multiplexing, buffer management, arcane packet header information,\nbyte-ordering, OS-dependent issues and much more. Libnet features portable\npacket creation interfaces at the IP layer and link layer, as well as a host\nof supplementary and complementary functionality.\n\nThis package contains an old and deprecated version of libnet. You need it\nonly if the software you are using hasn't been updated to work with the newer\nversion and the newer API.\n",
