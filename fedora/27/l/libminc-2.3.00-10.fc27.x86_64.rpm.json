            "Description": "\nThe MINC file format is a highly flexible medical image file format\nbuilt on the HDF5 generalized data format. The format is\nsimple, self-describing, extensible, portable and N-dimensional, with\nprogramming interfaces for both low-level data access and high-level\nvolume manipulation. On top of the libraries is a suite of generic\nimage-file manipulation tools. The format, libraries and tools are\ndesigned for use in a medical-imaging research environment : they are\nsimple and powerful and make no attempt to provide a pretty interface\nto users.\n",
