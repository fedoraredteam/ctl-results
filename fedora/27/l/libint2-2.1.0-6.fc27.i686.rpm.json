This is by\nfar the most common type of integrals in molecular structure theory.\n\nLIBINT uses recursive schemes that originate in seminal Obara-Saika method and\nHead-Gordon and Pople\u2019s variation thereof. The idea of LIBINT is to optimize\ncomputer implementation of such methods by implementing an optimizing compiler\nto generate automatically highly-specialized code that runs well on\nsuper-scalar architectures.\n",
