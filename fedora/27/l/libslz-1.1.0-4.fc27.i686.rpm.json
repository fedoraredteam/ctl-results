            "Description": "\nSLZ is a fast and memory-less stream compressor which produces an output that\ncan be decompressed with zlib or gzip. It does not implement decompression at\nall, zlib is perfectly fine for this.\n\nThe purpose is to use SLZ in situations where a zlib-compatible stream is\nneeded and zlib's resource usage would be too high while the compression ratio\nis not critical. The typical use case is in HTTP servers and gateways which\nhave to compress many streams in parallel with little CPU resources to assign\nto this task, and without having to limit the compression ratio due to the\nmemory usage. In such an environment, the server's memory usage can easily be\ndivided by 10 and the CPU usage by 3.\n",
