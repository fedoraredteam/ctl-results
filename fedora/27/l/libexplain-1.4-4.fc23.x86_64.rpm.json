This will make your application's\nerror messages much more informative to your users.  The library is\nnot quite a drop-in replacement for strerror, but it comes close. Each\nsystem call has a dedicated libexplain function.\n\nThe coverage for system calls is being improved all the time. Coverage\nincludes 159 system calls and 444 ioctl requests.\n",
