            "Description": "\nLibglade is a small library that allows a program to load its user interface\nfrom am XML description at runtime. Libglade uses the XML file format used by\nthe GLADE user interface builder GLADE, so libglade acts as an alternative to\nGLADE's code generation approach. Libglade also provides a simple interface\nfor connecting handlers to the various signals in the interface (on platforms\nwhere the gmodule library works correctly, it is possible to connect all the\nhandlers with a single function call). Once the interface has been\ninstantiated, libglade gives no overhead, so other than the short initial\ninterface loading time, there is no performance tradeoff.\n",
