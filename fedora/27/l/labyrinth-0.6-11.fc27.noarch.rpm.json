            "Description": "\nLabyrinth is a lightweight mind-mapping tool, written in Python using Gtk and\nCairo to do the drawing. It is intended to be as light and intuitive as\npossible, but still provide a wide range of powerful features.\n\nA mind-map is a diagram used to represent words, ideas, tasks or other items\nlinked to and arranged radially around a central key word or idea. It is used\nto generate, visualize, structure and classify ideas, and as an aid in study,\norganization, problem solving, and decision making. (From Wikipedia)\n\nCurrently, Labyrinth provides 3 different types of thoughts, or nodes - Text,\nImage and Drawing. Text is the basic standard text node. Images allow you to\ninsert and scale any supported image file (PNG, JPEG, SVG). Drawings are for\nthose times when you want to illustrate something, but don't want to fire up a\nseparate drawing program. It allows you to quickly and easily sketch very\nsimple line diagrams.\n",
