You can\nalso use Autotalent for more exotic effects, making your voice sound like a\nchiptune, adding artificial vibrato, or messing with your formants.\nAutotalent can also be used as a harmonizer that knows how to sing in the\nscale with you. Or, you can use Autotalent to change the scale of a melody\nbetween major and minor or to change the musical mode.\n",
