It can automatically generate full functioning C++ and JavaScript\nJSON-RPC Client classes, which are ready to use.\n\nFor JSON-RPC Server applications, this library can generate an abstract C++\nclass which just has to be sub classed and implement all pure virtual methods.\nTo make this possible, a interface description file (in the JSON format) is\nrequired, which lists all available methods with corresponding parameters and\ntypes.\n",
