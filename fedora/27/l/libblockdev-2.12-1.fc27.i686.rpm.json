            "Description": "\nThe libblockdev is a C library with GObject introspection support that can be\nused for doing low-level operations with block devices like setting up LVM,\nBTRFS, LUKS or MD RAID. The library uses plugins (LVM, BTRFS,...) and serves as\na thin wrapper around its plugins' functionality. All the plugins, however, can\nbe used as standalone libraries. One of the core principles of libblockdev is\nthat it is stateless from the storage configuration's perspective (e.g. it has\nno information about VGs when creating an LV).\n",
