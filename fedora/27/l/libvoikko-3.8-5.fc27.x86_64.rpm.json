The library is written in C.\n\nCurrently only Finnish is supported, but the API of the library has been\ndesigned to allow adding support for other languages later. Note however that\nMalaga is rather low level tool that requires implementing the whole morphology\nof a language as a left associative grammar. Therefore languages that have\nsimple or even moderately complex morphologies and do not require morphological\nanalysis in their hyphenators should be implemented using other tools such as\nHunspell.\n",
