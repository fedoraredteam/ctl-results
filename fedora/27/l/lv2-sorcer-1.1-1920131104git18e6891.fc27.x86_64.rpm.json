            "Description": "\nSorcer is a polyphonic wavetable synth LV2 plugin. Its sonic fingerprint is\none of harsh modulated sub-bass driven walls of sound. Two morphing wavetable\noscillators and one sine oscillator provide the generation routines. The LFO\ncan be mapped to wavetable modulation as well as filter cutoff. An ADSR allows\nfor shaping the resulting sound, while a master volume finishes the signal\nchain. Easily creating a variety of dubstep basslines and harsh pad sounds.\n\nAdditional presets can be found here:\n https://github.com/harryhaaren/openAV-presets\n",
