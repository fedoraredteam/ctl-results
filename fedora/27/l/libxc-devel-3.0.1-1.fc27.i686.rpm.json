            "Description": "\nlibxc is a library of exchange and correlation functionals. Its purpose is to\nbe used in codes that implement density-functional theory. For the moment, the\nlibrary includes most of the local density approximations (LDAs), generalized\ndensity approximation (GGAs), and meta-GGAs. The library provides values for\nthe energy density and its 1st, 2nd, and (for the LDAs) 3rd derivatives.\n\nThis package contains the development headers and library that are necessary\nin order to compile programs against libxc.\n",
