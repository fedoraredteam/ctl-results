It supports\nsections and (lists of) values (strings, integers, floats,\nbooleans or other sections), as well as some other features (such\nas single/double-quoted strings, environment variable expansion,\nfunctions and nested include statements). It makes it very\neasy to add configuration file capability to a program using\na simple API.\n\nThe goal of libConfuse is not to be the configuration file parser\nlibrary with a gazillion of features. Instead, it aims to be\neasy to use and quick to integrate with your code.\n",
