It was initially\nimplemented to address AfterStep Window Manager's needs for image handling,\nbut it evolved into extremely powerful and flexible software, suitable for\nvirtually any project that has needs for loading, manipulating, displaying\nimages, as well as writing images in files. Most of the popular image formats\nare supported using standard libraries, with XCF, XPM, PPM/PNM, BMP, ICO,\nTGA and GIF being supported internally.\n\nPNG, JPEG and TIFF formats are supported via standard libraries.\n\nPowerful text rendering capabilities included, providing support for\nTrueType fonts using FreeType library, and anti-aliasing of standard fonts\nfrom X window system.\n",
