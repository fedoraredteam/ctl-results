            "Description": "\nlevmar is a native ANSI C implementation of the Levenberg-Marquardt\noptimization algorithm.  Both unconstrained and constrained (under linear\nequations, inequality and box constraints) Levenberg-Marquardt variants are\nincluded.  The LM algorithm is an iterative technique that finds a local\nminimum of a function that is expressed as the sum of squares of nonlinear\nfunctions.  It has become a standard technique for nonlinear least-squares\nproblems and can be thought of as a combination of steepest descent and the\nGauss-Newton method.  When the current solution is far from the correct on,\nthe algorithm behaves like a steepest descent method: slow, but guaranteed\nto converge.  When the current solution is close to the correct solution, it\nbecomes a Gauss-Newton method.\n",
