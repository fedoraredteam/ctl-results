            "Description": "\nLutok provides thin C++ wrappers around the Lua C API to ease the\ninteraction between C++ and Lua.  These wrappers make intensive use of\nRAII to prevent resource leakage, expose C++-friendly data types, report\nerrors by means of exceptions and ensure that the Lua stack is always\nleft untouched in the face of errors.  The library also provides a small\nsubset of miscellaneous utility functions built on top of the wrappers.\n\nLutok focuses on providing a clean and safe C++ interface; the drawback\nis that it is not suitable for performance-critical environments.  In\norder to implement error-safe C++ wrappers on top of a Lua C binary\nlibrary, Lutok adds several layers or abstraction and error checking\nthat go against the original spirit of the Lua C API and thus degrade\nperformance.\n",
