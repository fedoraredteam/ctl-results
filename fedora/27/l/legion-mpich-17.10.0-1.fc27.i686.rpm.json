            "Description": "\nLegion is a data-centric parallel programming system for writing portable\nhigh performance programs targeted at distributed heterogeneous architectures.\nLegion presents abstractions which allow programmers to describe properties of\nprogram data (e.g. independence, locality). By making the Legion programming\nsystem aware of the structure of program data, it can automate many of the\ntedious tasks programmers currently face, including correctly extracting task-\nand data-level parallelism and moving data around complex memory hierarchies.\nA novel mapping interface provides explicit programmer controlled placement of\ndata in the memory hierarchy and assignment of tasks to processors in a way that\nis orthogonal to correctness, thereby enabling easy porting and tuning of Legion\napplications to new architectures.\n\nLegion compiled with MPICH, package incl. binaries and libraries\n",
