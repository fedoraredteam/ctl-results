            "Description": "\nlibpolyxmass is a library that implements some housekeeping\nfunctionalities and polymer chemistry-related functionalities that are\nused in the other modules of the GNU polyxmass mass spectrometry\nframework. It was born as the merge of the two libpxmutils and\nlibpxmchem libraries (last versions of these two libraries were for\nboth 0.7.0). This fact is still visible as the files do have either\n\"pxmutils-\" or \"pxmchem-\" as prefix in their name. This nomenclature\nis going to be maintained as it helps understanding the\nfunctionalities that are housed in the different files of the new\nlibrary.\n",
