Originally part of the Gtk--\nwidget set, libsigc++20 is now a separate library to provide for more general\nuse. It is the most complete library of its kind with the ability to connect\nan abstract callback to a class method, function, or function object. It\ncontains adaptor classes for connection of dissimilar callbacks and has an\nease of use unmatched by other C++ callback libraries.\n\nPackage GTK-- (gtkmm), which is a C++ binding to the GTK+ library,\nstarting with version 1.1.2, uses libsigc++20.\n",
