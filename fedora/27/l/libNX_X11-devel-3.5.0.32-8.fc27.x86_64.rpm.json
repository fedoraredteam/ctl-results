X display servers run on computers with either\nmonochrome or color bitmap display hardware. The server distributes\nuser input to and accepts output requests from various client\nprograms located either on the same machine or elsewhere in the\nnetwork. Xlib is a C subroutine library that application programs\n(clients) use to interface with the window system by means of a\nstream connection.\n\nThis package contains all necessary include files and libraries\nneeded to develop applications that require these.\n",
