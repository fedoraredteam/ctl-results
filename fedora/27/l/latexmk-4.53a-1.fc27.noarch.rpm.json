It has\na number of other useful capabilities, for example to start a previewer and\nthen run latex whenever the source files are updated, so that the previewer\ngives an up-to-date view of the document.  The script runs on both UNIX and\nMS-WINDOWS (95, ME, XP, etc).  This script is a corrected and improved\nversion of the original version of latexmk.\n\nBefore using a previewer, read the file README.fedora.\n",
