            "Description": "\nThe Async library is a programming framework that is used to write event driven\napplications. It provides abstractions for file descriptor watches, timers,\nnetwork communications, serial port communications and config file reading.\n\nAsync is written in such a way that it can support other frameworks. Right now\nthere are two basic frameworks, a simple \"select\" based implementation and a Qt\nimplementation. The idea is that advanced libraries can be implemented in such\na way that they only depend on Async. That means that these libraries can be\nused in both Qt and pure console applications and in any future frameworks\nsupported by Async (e.g. Gtk, wxWidgets etc).\n\nAnother big part of Async is the audio pipe framework. It is an audio handling\nframework that is geared towards single channel (mono) audio applications. The\nframework consists of a large number of audio handling classes such as\naudio i/o, filtering, mixing, audio codecs etc.\n",
