With its simple toolbar interface and simulation of circuits as you\nbuild them, it is simple enough to facilitate learning the most basic concepts\nrelated to logic circuits. With the capacity to build larger circuits from\nsmaller subcircuits, and to draw bundles of wires with a single mouse drag,\nLogisim can be used (and is used) to design and simulate entire CPUs for\neducational purposes.\n",
