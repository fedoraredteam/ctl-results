            "Description": "\nLIBXSMM is a library for small dense and small sparse matrix-matrix\nmultiplications, as well as for deep learning primitives such as small\nconvolutions targeting Intel Architecture (x86).  The library\ngenerates code for the following instruction set extensions: Intel\nSSE, Intel AVX, Intel AVX2, IMCI (KNCni) for Intel Xeon Phi\ncoprocessors (\"KNC\"), and Intel AVX\u2011512 as found in the Intel Xeon Phi\nprocessor family (\"KNL\") and future Intel Xeon processors.  Small\nconvolutions are currently only optimized for Intel AVX\u2011512.\nHistorically the library was solely targeting the Intel Many\nIntegrated Core Architecture \"MIC\") using intrinsic functions.\nCurrently, optimized assembly code targets all aforementioned\ninstruction set extensions (static code generation), and Just\u2011In\u2011Time\n(JIT) code generation targets Intel AVX and beyond.\n",
