This API ('LV2') attempts\nto give programmers the ability to write simple 'plugin' audio\nprocessors in C/C++ and link them dynamically ('plug') into a range of\nthese packages ('hosts').  It should be possible for any host and any\nplugin to communicate completely through this interface.\n\nLV2 is a successor to LADSPA, created to address the limitations of\nLADSPA which many hosts have outgrown.\n",
