It\ngives you the power of Lua combined with a rich set of features.\n\nMoonScript can either be compiled into Lua and run at a later time, or\nit can be dynamically compiled and run using the moonloader. It\u2019s as\nsimple as require \"moonscript\" in order to have Lua understand how to\nload and run any MoonScript file.\n\nBecause it compiles right into Lua code, it is completely compatible\nwith alternative Lua implementations like LuaJIT, and it is also\ncompatible with all existing Lua code and libraries.\n\nThe command line tools also let you run MoonScript directly from the\ncommand line, like any first-class scripting language.\n",
