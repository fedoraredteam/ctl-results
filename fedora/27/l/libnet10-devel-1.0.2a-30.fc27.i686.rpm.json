Using libnet, quick and\nsimple packet assembly applications can be whipped up with little effort.\nWith a bit more time, more complex programs can be written (traceroute and\nping were easily rewritten using libnet and libpcap).\n\nThis package contains an old and deprecated version of libnet. You need it\nonly if the software you are using hasn't been updated to work with the newer\nversion and the newer API.\n",
