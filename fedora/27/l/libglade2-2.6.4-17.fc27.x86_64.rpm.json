            "Description": "\nLibglade is a small library that allows a program to load its user\ninterface from am XML description at runtime. Libglade uses the XML\nfile format used by the GLADE user interface builder GLADE, so\nlibglade acts as an alternative to GLADE's code generation\napproach. Libglade also provides a simple interface for connecting\nhandlers to the various signals in the interface (on platforms where\nthe gmodule library works correctly, it is possible to connect all the\nhandlers with a single function call). Once the interface has been\ninstantiated, libglade gives no overhead, so other than the short\ninitial interface loading time, there is no performance tradeoff.\n",
