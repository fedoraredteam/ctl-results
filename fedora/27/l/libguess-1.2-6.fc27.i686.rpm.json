The advantage of this is that all character sets can be\nchecked in parallel, and quickly. Right now, libguess passes a byte to\neach DFA on the same pass, meaning that the winning character set can be\ndeduced as efficiently as possible.\n\nlibguess is fully reentrant, using only local stack memory for DFA\noperations.\n",
