            "Description": "\nLZ4 compression for Java, based on Yann Collet's work.\nThis library provides access to two compression methods\nthat both generate a valid LZ4 stream:\n\n* fast scan (LZ4):\n    \u00b0 low memory footprint (~ 16 KB),\n    \u00b0 very fast (fast scan with skipping heuristics in case the\n      input looks incompressible),\n    \u00b0 reasonable compression ratio (depending on the\n      redundancy of the input).\n* high compression (LZ4 HC):\n    \u00b0 medium memory footprint (~ 256 KB),\n    \u00b0 rather slow (~ 10 times slower than LZ4),\n    \u00b0 good compression ratio (depending on the size and\n      the redundancy of the input).\n\nThe streams produced by those 2 compression algorithms use the\nsame compression format, are very fast to decompress and can be\ndecompressed by the same decompressor instance.\n",
