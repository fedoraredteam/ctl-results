            "Description": "\nLure of the Temptress was Revolution's very first adventure game and work began\non it in 1989, even before Revolution's inception as an actual games\ndevelopment company. From the start our aim was to consider the contemporary\nadventures of the day and then bring something new to the genre. From this came\nthe Virtual Theatre engine. VT allowed in-game characters to wander around the\ngameworld indepently of each other, living their own lives and doing their own\nthing. Another feature allowed the player to give direct orders to Helper\ncharacters - in this case Ratpouch - who would then go off to perform the task.\n\nThe result is a quirky and entertaining adventure game that kicked off\nRevolution's fondness for characterisation and in-game humour.\n",
