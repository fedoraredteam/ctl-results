            "Description": "\nStore your UNIX user accounts in MySQL. \"libnss-mysql\" enables the following:\n\n* System-wide authentication and name service using a MySQL database.\n  Applications do not need to be MySQL-aware or modified in any way.\n\n* Storing authentication information in a database instead of text files.\n\n* Creation of a single authentication database for multiple servers.\n  This is often referred to as the \"Single Sign-on\" problem.\n\n* Writing data-modification routines (IE self-management web interface).\n\nlibnss-mysql is similar to NIS or LDAP. It provides the same centralized\nauthentication service through a database. What does this mean? Username,\nuid, gid, password, etc comes from a MySQL database instead of\n/etc/password, /etc/shadow, and /etc/group. A user configured in MySQL will\nlook and behave just like a user configured in /etc/passwd. Your\napplications such as ls, finger, sendmail, qmail, exim, postfix, proftpd,\nX, sshd, etc. will all 'see' these users!\n",
