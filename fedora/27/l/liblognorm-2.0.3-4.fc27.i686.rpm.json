            "Description": "\nBriefly described, liblognorm is a tool to normalize log data.\n\nPeople who need to take a look at logs often have a common problem. Logs from\ndifferent machines (from different vendors) usually have different formats for\ntheir logs. Even if it is the same type of log (e.g. from firewalls), the log\nentries are so different, that it is pretty hard to read these. This is where\nliblognorm comes into the game. With this tool you can normalize all your logs.\nAll you need is liblognorm and its dependencies and a sample database that fits\nthe logs you want to normalize.\n",
