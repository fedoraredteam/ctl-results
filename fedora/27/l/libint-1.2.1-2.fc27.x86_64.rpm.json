            "Description": "\nLIBINT computes the Coulomb and exchange integrals, which in electronic\nstructure theory are called electron repulsion integrals (ERIs). This is by\nfar the most common type of integrals in molecular structure theory.\n\nLIBINT uses recursive schemes that originate in seminal Obara-Saika method and\nHead-Gordon and Pople\u2019s variation thereof. The idea of LIBINT is to optimize\ncomputer implementation of such methods by implementing an optimizing compiler\nto generate automatically highly-specialized code that runs well on\nsuper-scalar architectures.\n",
