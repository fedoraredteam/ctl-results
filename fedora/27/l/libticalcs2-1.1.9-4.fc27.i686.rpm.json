Currently, it does not\nsupport some education devices (such as CBL/CBR and others).\nThis library is able to communicate with handhelds in a fairly\ntransparent fashion. With this library, the developer does not\nhave to worry about the packet oriented protocol, the file\nmanagement and some other stuff.\n",
