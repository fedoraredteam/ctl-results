            "Description": "\nJCSP (Communication Sequential Processes for Java) is a\nlibrary providing a concurrency model that is a combination\nof ideas from Hoare's CSP and Milner's pi-calculus.\n\nCommunicating Sequential Processes (CSP) is a mathematical\ntheory for specifying and verifying complex patterns of\nbehavior arising from interactions between concurrent\nobjects.\n\nJCSP provides a base range of CSP primitives plus a rich set of\nextensions. Also included is a package providing CSP process\nwrappers giving a channel interface to all Java AWT widgets\nand graphics operations.  It is extensively (java/documented)\nand includes much teaching.\n\nJCSP is an alternative concurrency model to the threads and\nmechanisms built into Java. It is also compatible with\nit since it is implemented on top of it.\n",
