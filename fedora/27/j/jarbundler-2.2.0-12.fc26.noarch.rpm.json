You've written a little\nJava utility, or maybe even a more complex application, and you\nwant to create Mac OS X application bundle for easy distribution.\n\nYou'd like to be able to do it automatically from your build\nprocess, but you're forced to go run the Apple Jar Bundler and\ntweak all the settings manually every time you build.\n\nWell no more! JarBundler is a feature-rich Ant task which will\ncreate a Mac OS X application bundle from a list of Jar files and\na main class name. You can add an Icon resource, set various Mac\nOS X native look-and-feel bells and whistles, and maintain your\napplication bundles as part of your normal build and release\ncycle. It is free software licensed under the GNU General Public\nLicense.\n",
