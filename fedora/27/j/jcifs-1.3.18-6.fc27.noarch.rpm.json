It is an advanced\nimplementation of the CIFS protocol supporting Unicode, batching,\nmultiplexing of threaded callers, encrypted authentication,\ntransactions, the Remote Access Protocol (RAP), and much more. It is\nlicensed under LGPL which means commercial organizations can\nlegitimately use it with their proprietary code(you just can't sell or\ngive away a modified binary only version of the library itself without\nreciprocation).\n",
