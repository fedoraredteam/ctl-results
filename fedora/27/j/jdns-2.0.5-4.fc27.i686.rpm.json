Multicast support is based on Jeremie\nMiller's \"mdnsd\" implementation.\n\nFor maximum flexibility, JDNS is written in C with no direct\ndependencies, and is licensed under the MIT license. Your application\nmust supply functionality to JDNS, such as UDP sending/receiving, via\ncallbacks.\n\nQt-based command-line tool called \u2018jdns\u2019 that can be used to test\nfunctionality.\n",
