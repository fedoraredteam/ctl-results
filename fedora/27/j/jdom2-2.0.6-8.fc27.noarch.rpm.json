            "Description": "\nJDOM is a Java-oriented object model which models XML documents.\nIt provides a Java-centric means of generating and manipulating\nXML documents. While JDOM inter-operates well with existing\nstandards such as the Simple API for XML (SAX) and the Document\nObject Model (DOM), it is not an abstraction layer or\nenhancement to those APIs. Rather, it seeks to provide a robust,\nlight-weight means of reading and writing XML data without the\ncomplex and memory-consumptive options that current API\nofferings provide.\n",
