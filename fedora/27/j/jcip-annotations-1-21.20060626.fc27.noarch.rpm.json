            "Description": "\nThis package provides class, field, and method level annotations for\ndescribing thread-safety policies.  These annotations are relatively\nunintrusive and are beneficial to both users and maintainers.  Users can see\nimmediately whether a class is thread-safe, and maintainers can see\nimmediately whether thread-safety guarantees must be preserved.  Annotations\nare also useful to a third constituency: tools.  Static code-analysis tools\nmay be able to verify that the code complies with the contract indicated by\nthe annotation, such as verifying that a class annotated with @Immutable\nactually is immutable.\n",
