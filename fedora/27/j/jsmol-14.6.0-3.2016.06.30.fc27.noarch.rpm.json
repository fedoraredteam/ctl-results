            "Description": "\nJSmol is the extension of the Java-based molecular visualization\napplet Jmol (jmol.sourceforge.net) as an HTML5 JavaScript-only\nweb app. It can be used in conjunction with the Java applet to\nprovide an alternative to Java when the platform does not support\nthat (iPhone/iPad) or does not support applets (Android). Used in\nconjunction with the Jmol JavaScript Object\n(http://wiki.jmol.org/index.php/Jmol_Javascript_Object ), JSmol\nseamlessly offers alternatives to Java on these non-Applet platforms.\n\nJSmol can read all the files that Jmol reads. You can do all the\nscripting that Jmol does. You can create all the buttons and links\nand such that you are used to creating for Jmol. All of the rendering\ncapability of the Jmol applet is there. JSmol has both a console and\na popup menu.\n\nJSmol is integrated fully with JSME and JSpecView.\n\nA \"lite\" version of JSmol provides minimal functionality\n(balls and sticks only) for extremely small-bandwith apps.\n",
