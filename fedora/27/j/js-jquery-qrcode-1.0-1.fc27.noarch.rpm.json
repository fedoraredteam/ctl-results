            "Description": "\njquery.qrcode.js is jquery plugin for a pure browser qrcode generation.\nIt allows you to easily add qrcode to your web pages. It is standalone,\nand less than 4 kB after minify+gzip. It doesn't rely on external\nservices which go on and off, or add latency while loading. It is based\non qrcode-generator which builds qrcodes in various language.\njquery.qrcode.js wraps that library to make it easy to include in your\nwebsite.\n\nNote: The upstream version of this library bundles qrcode-generator into\nthis package, but Fedora has chosen to unbundle it. Thus, you will need\nto include qrcode.js from js-qrcode-generator in a script tag before\nincluding this script if you wish to use this library.\n",
