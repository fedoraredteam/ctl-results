            "Description": "\nJython is an implementation of the high-level, dynamic, object-oriented\nlanguage Python seamlessly integrated with the Java platform. The\npredecessor to Jython, JPython, is certified as 100% Pure Java. Jython is\nfreely available for both commercial and non-commercial use and is\ndistributed with source code. Jython is complementary to Java and is\nespecially suited for the following tasks: Embedded scripting - Java\nprogrammers can add the Jython libraries to their system to allow end\nusers to write simple or complicated scripts that add functionality to the\napplication. Interactive experimentation - Jython provides an interactive\ninterpreter that can be used to interact with Java packages or with\nrunning Java applications. This allows programmers to experiment and debug\nany Java system using Jython. Rapid application development - Python\nprograms are typically 2-10X shorter than the equivalent Java program.\nThis translates directly to increased programmer productivity. The\nseamless interaction between Python and Java allows developers to freely\nmix the two languages both during development and in shipping products.\n",
