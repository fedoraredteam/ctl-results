            "Description": "\nJetty is a 100% Java HTTP Server and Servlet Container. This means that you\ndo not need to configure and run a separate web server (like Apache) in order\nto use Java, servlets and JSPs to generate dynamic content. Jetty is a fully\nfeatured web server for static and dynamic content. Unlike separate\nserver/container solutions, this means that your web server and web\napplication run in the same process, without interconnection overheads\nand complications. Furthermore, as a pure java component, Jetty can be simply\nincluded in your application for demonstration, distribution or deployment.\nJetty is available on all Java supported platforms.\n",
