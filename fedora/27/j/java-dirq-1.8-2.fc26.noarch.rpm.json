It focuses on simplicity, robustness and scalability.\n\nThis module allows multiple concurrent readers and writers to interact with\nthe same queue.\n\nA Perl implementation (Directory::Queue) and a Python implementation (dirq)\nof the same algorithm are available so readers and writers can be written in\ndifferent programming languages.\n",
