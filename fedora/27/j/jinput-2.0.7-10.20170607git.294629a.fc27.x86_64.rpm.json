It is part of a suite of open-source technologies\ninitiated by the Game Technology Group at Sun Microsystems with the\nintention of making the development of high performance games in Java a\nreality.  The API itself is pure Java and presents a platform-neutral,\ncompletely portable model of controller discovery and polling.  It can\nhandle arbitrary controllers and returns both human and machine\nunderstandable descriptions of the inputs available.\n",
