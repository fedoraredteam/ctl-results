            "Description": "\njbig2dec is a decoder implementation of the JBIG2 image compression format.\nJBIG2 is designed for lossy or lossless encoding of 'bilevel' (1-bit\nmonochrome) images at moderately high resolution, and in particular scanned\npaper documents. In this domain it is very efficient, offering compression\nratios on the order of 100:1.\n\nThis package is only needed if you plan to develop or compile applications\nwhich requires the jbig2dec library.\n",
