            "Description": "\nJSAP not only syntactically validates your program's command line\narguments, but it converts those arguments into objects you specify. If you\ntell JSAP that one of your parameters is an Integer, for example, and the\nuser does not provide a String that can be converted to an Integer when\ninvoking the program, JSAP will throw a ParseException when you have it\nparse the command line. If no exception is thrown, you are guaranteed an\nInteger when you request that parameter's value from your program. There's\na pretty big (and growing) list of return types supported by JSAP, including\nIntegers, Floats, Dates, URLs, and even java.awt.Colors; you can also add\nyour own in a matter of minutes.\n",
