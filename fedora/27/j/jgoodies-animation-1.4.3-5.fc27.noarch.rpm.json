It uses concepts and notions as described by the W3C\nspecification for the Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL).\n\nThis animation framework has been designed for a seemless, flexible\nand powerful integration with Java, ease-of-use and a small library size.\nUnlike SMIL we use Java to describe the animations \u2013 not XML.\n",
