            "Description": "\nThe Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is perhaps the most significant\nprotocol used on the Internet today. Web services, network-enabled\nappliances and the growth of network computing continue to expand the\nrole of the HTTP protocol beyond user-driven web browsers, and increase\nthe number of applications that may require HTTP support.\nAlthough the java.net package provides basic support for accessing\nresources via HTTP, it doesn't provide the full flexibility or\nfunctionality needed by many applications. The Jakarta Commons HTTP\nClient component seeks to fill this void by providing an efficient,\nup-to-date, and feature-rich package implementing the client side of the\nmost recent HTTP standards and recommendations.\nDesigned for extension while providing robust support for the base HTTP\nprotocol, the HTTP Client component may be of interest to anyone\nbuilding HTTP-aware client applications such as web browsers, web\nservice clients, or systems that leverage or extend the HTTP protocol\nfor distributed communication.\n",
