            "Description": "\nJavaEWAH is a word-aligned compressed variant of the Java bitset class.\nIt uses a 64-bit run-length encoding (RLE) compression scheme.\n\nThe goal of word-aligned compression is not to achieve the best\ncompression, but rather to improve query processing time. Hence, we try\nto save CPU cycles, maybe at the expense of storage. However, the EWAH\nscheme we implemented is always more efficient storage-wise than an\nuncompressed bitmap (implemented in Java as the BitSet class). Unlike\nsome alternatives, javaewah does not rely on a patented scheme.\n",
