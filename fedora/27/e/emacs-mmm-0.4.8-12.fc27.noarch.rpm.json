            "Description": "\nMMM Mode is an emacs add-on package providing a minor mode that allows\nMultiple Major Modes to coexist in one buffer. It is particularly\nwell-suited to editing embedded code or code that generates other\ncode, such as Mason or Embperl server-side Perl code, or HTML output\nby CGI scripts.\n\nMMM Mode defines a general syntax--the \"submode class\"--for telling it\nhow one major mode should be embedded in another. At present, the list\nof supplied submode classes is rather limited, but that will hopefully\nchange soon. Contributions are always welcome; writing a submode class\ncan be a good introduction to Emacs Lisp, and is usually a simple\nexcercise for those already proficient. MMM Mode was originally\ndesigned to work in Emacs 19 and 20 and XEmacs 20 and 21.\n\nThis has been created as an emacs-only package as it already exists\nfor XEmacs in xemacs-packages-extra.\n",
