It hooks into yum to automatically\ncommit changes made to /etc during package upgrades. It tracks file\nmetadata that version control systems do not normally support, but that\nis important for /etc, such as the permissions of /etc/shadow. It's\nquite modular and configurable, while also being simple to use if you\nunderstand the basics of working with version control.\n\nThe default backend is git, if want to use a another backend please\ninstall the appropriate tool (mercurial, darcs or bzr).\nTo use bzr as backend, please also install the etckeeper-bzr package.\n\nTo start using the package please read /usr/share/doc/etckeeper/README.\n",
