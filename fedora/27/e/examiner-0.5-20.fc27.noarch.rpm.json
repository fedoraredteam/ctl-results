This app was designed to analyze static\ncompiled binaries but works ok with others. The intention is for forensic\nresearch but could also be used in general reverse engineering.\nThis program can only handle basic dissassembly. If the binary has been modified\nto resist debugging then the Examinier probably will not be able to analyze the\ncode. Also the Examiner will not analyze live running code.\n",
