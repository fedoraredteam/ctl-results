It provides a distributed,\nmultitenant-capable full-text search engine with a RESTful web interface and\nschema-free JSON documents. Elasticsearch is developed in Java and is released\nas open source under the terms of the Apache License.\n\nIt is a flexible and powerful open source, distributed, real-time\nsearch and analytics engine.\n\nArchitected from the ground up for use in distributed environments where\nreliability and scalability are must haves, Elasticsearch gives you the ability\nto move easily beyond simple full-text search.\n\nThrough its robust set of APIs and query DSLs, plus clients for the most popular\nprogramming languages, Elasticsearch delivers on the near limitless promises of\nsearch technology.\n",
