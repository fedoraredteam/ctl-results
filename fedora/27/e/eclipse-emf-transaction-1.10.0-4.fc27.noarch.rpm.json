In particular, this allows\napplications to analyze change sets in their entirety. For a simplified\nprogramming model, the API automatically tracks changes applied to models\nwithout the need for client code to use EMF edit commands. These changes are\nencapsulated in transactions/operations that can undo and redo themselves.\n",
