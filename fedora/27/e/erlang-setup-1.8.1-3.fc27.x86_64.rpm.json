            "Description": "\nWhile Erlang/OTP comes with many wonderful applications, including the Mnesia\nDBMS, there is no standard or convention for installing a system. Erlang/OTP\nprovides tools for building a boot script, and rules for setting environment\nvariables, etc., and Mnesia offers an API for creating and modifying the\ndatabase schema.\n\nHowever, with no convention for when these tools and API functions are called -\nand by whom - application developers are left having to invent a lot of code\nand scripts, not to mention meditate over chapters of Erlang/OTP documentation\nin order to figure out how things fit together.\n\nThis utility offers a framework for initializing and configuring a system, with\na set of conventions allowing each component to provide callbacks for different\nsteps in the installation procedure.\n\nThe callbacks are defined through OTP application environment variables, which\ncan easily be overriden at install time.\n",
