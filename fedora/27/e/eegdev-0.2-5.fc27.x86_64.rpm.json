This interface has been designed to\nbe both flexible and efficient. The device specific part is implemented by the\nmean of plugins which makes adding new device backend fairly easy even if the\nlibrary does not support them yet officially.\n\nThe core library not only provides to users a unified and consistent interfaces\nto the acquisition device but it also provides many functionalities to the\ndevice backends (plugins) ranging from configuration to data casting and scaling\nmaking writing new device backend an easy task.\n",
