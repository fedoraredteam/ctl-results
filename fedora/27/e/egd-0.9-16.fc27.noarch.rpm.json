            "Description": "\nEGD is an Entropy Gathering Daemon meant to be used on systems that can run GPG\nbut which don't have a convenient (or reliable) source of random bits. It is a\nregular user-space program that sits around, running programs like 'w' and\n'last' and 'vmstat', collecting the randomness (or at least the\nunpredictability) inherent in the output of these system statistics programs\nwhen used on a reasonably busy system. It slowly stirs the output of these\ngathering programs into a pool of entropy, much like the linux kernel device,\nand allows other programs to read out random bits from this pool.\n",
