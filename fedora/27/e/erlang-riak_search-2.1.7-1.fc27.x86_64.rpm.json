Previously Riak Search was a\nrelease in it\u2019s own right. Since then Basho has decided it would be easier for\nour users if Search was simply a set of functionality that can be enabled via a\nconfig option. For that reason, if you want to use Search you\u2019ll have to build\na Riak release and enable it.\n",
