            "Description": "\nThe undo-tree-mode provided by this package replaces Emacs' undo system with a\nsystem that treats undo history as what it is: a branching tree of changes. This\nsimple idea allows the more intuitive behavior of the standard undo/redo system\nto be combined with the power of never losing any history. An added side bonus\nis that undo history can in some cases be stored more efficiently, allowing more\nchanges to accumulate before Emacs starts discarding history.\n\nYou don't have to imagine the undo tree, because undo-tree-mode includes an\nundo-tree visualizer which draws it for you, and lets you browse around the undo\nhistory.\n",
