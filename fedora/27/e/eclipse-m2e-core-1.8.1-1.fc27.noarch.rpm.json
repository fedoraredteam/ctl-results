For Java developers, the very tight integration with JDT\ngreatly simplifies the consumption of Java artifacts either being hosted on open\nsource repositories such as Maven Central, or in your in-house Maven repository.\n\nm2e is also a platform that let others provide better integration with\nadditional Maven plugins (e.g. Android, web development, etc.), and facilitates\nthe distribution of those extensions through the m2e marketplace.\n",
