Written originally at\nKarl-Franzens-Universit\u00e4t Graz as a milestone of the EXCITING EU Research and\nTraining Network, the code is designed to be as simple as possible so that new\ndevelopments in the field of density functional theory (DFT) can be added\nquickly and reliably.\n\nThis package contains the species files.\n",
