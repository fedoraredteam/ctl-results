No coordinates are displayed,\n   so not very useful\n - polarplot.jpg - Polar plot with cardioid pattern\n - polarplot.png - Same as polarplot.jpg but in png format\n - testcase.jpg - Simple graph that serves as an excellent starting point for the\n   new user\n - testcase.png - Same as testcase.jpg but in png format\n - testcoords.jpg - Advanced graph used by developers to check the affine\n   transformations in Engauge\n - testcoords.sxd - Open Office document used to create testcoords.jpg\n   (not an image!)\n - usgs.png - Fictional map loosely based on U.S. Geological Survey\n   topographic maps\n",
