GEM also includes\nfeatures to help users understand and debug the program across all platforms\non which it may be run (e.g. highlighting deadlocks that may occur due to\ndiffering communication buffer allocations). For a given test harness, GEM\nwill allow you to explore only the relevant process interleavings, which are\nmuch smaller than the number of total feasible interleavings. GEM also\nguarantees to discover and explore all non-deterministic matches at run-time.\n",
