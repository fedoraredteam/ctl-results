            "Description": "\nA consensus library that supports creating multiple consensus groups\n(ensembles). Each ensemble is a separate Multi-Paxos instance with its own\nleader, set of members, and state.\n\nEach ensemble also supports an extended API that provides consistent key/value\noperations. Conceptually, this is identical to treating each key as a separate\nPaxos entity. However, this isn't accomplished by having each key maintain its\nown Paxos group. Instead, an ensemble emulates per-key consensus through a\ncombination of per-key and per-ensemble state.\n",
