Pymacs aims\nPython as an extension language for Emacs rather than the other way\naround, and this asymmetry is reflected in some design choices. Within\nEmacs Lisp code, one may load and use Python modules. Python functions\nmay themselves use Emacs services, and handle Emacs Lisp objects kept\nin Emacs Lisp space.\n",
