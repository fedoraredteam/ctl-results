A\ncommon use case for kvc is to quickly access one or more deep values in decoded\nJSON, or some other nested data structure. It can also help with some aggregate\noperations. It solves similar problems that you might want to use a tool like\nXPath or jQuery for, but it is far simpler and strictly less powerful. It's\ninspired by Apple's NSKeyValueCoding protocol from Objective-C.\n",
