It is\ndesigned from the ground up to allow for multiple assembler syntaxes to be\nsupported (eg, NASM, TASM, GAS, etc.) in addition to multiple output object\nformats and even multiple instruction sets. Another primary module of the\noverall design is an optimizer module.\nInstall this package if you need to rebuild applications that use yasm.\n",
