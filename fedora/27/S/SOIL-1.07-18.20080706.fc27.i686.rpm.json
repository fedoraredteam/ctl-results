It\nis based on stb_image version 1.16, the public domain code from Sean Barrett.\nThe author has extended it to load TGA and DDS files, and to perform common\nfunctions needed in loading OpenGL textures. SOIL can also be used to save and\nload images in a variety of formats (useful for loading height maps, non-OpenGL\napplications, etc.)\n",
