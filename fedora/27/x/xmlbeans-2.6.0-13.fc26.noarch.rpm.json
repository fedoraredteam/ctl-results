            "Description": "\nXMLBeans is a tool that allows you to access the full power\nof XML in a Java friendly way. It is an XML-Java binding tool.\nThe idea is that you can take advantage the richness and\nfeatures of XML and XML Schema and have these features mapped\nas naturally as possible to the equivalent Java language and\ntyping constructs. XMLBeans uses XML Schema to compile Java\ninterfaces and classes that you can then use to access and\nmodify XML instance data. Using XMLBeans is similar to using\nany other Java interface/class, you will see things like\ngetFoo or setFoo just as you would expect when working with\nJava. While a major use of XMLBeans is to access your XML\ninstance data with strongly typed Java classes there are also\nAPI's that allow you access to the full XML infoset (XMLBeans\nkeeps full XML Infoset fidelity) as well as to allow you to\nreflect into the XML schema itself through an XML Schema\nObject model.\n",
