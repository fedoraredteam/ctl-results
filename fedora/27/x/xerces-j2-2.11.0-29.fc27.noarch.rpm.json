            "Description": "\nWelcome to the future! Xerces2 is the next generation of high performance,\nfully compliant XML parsers in the Apache Xerces family. This new version of\nXerces introduces the Xerces Native Interface (XNI), a complete framework for\nbuilding parser components and configurations that is extremely modular and\neasy to program.\n\nThe Apache Xerces2 parser is the reference implementation of XNI but other\nparser components, configurations, and parsers can be written using the Xerces\nNative Interface. For complete design and implementation documents, refer to\nthe XNI Manual.\n\nXerces2 is a fully conforming XML Schema processor. For more information,\nrefer to the XML Schema page.\n\nXerces2 also provides a complete implementation of the Document Object Model\nLevel 3 Core and Load/Save W3C Recommendations and provides a complete\nimplementation of the XML Inclusions (XInclude) W3C Recommendation. It also\nprovides support for OASIS XML Catalogs v1.1.\n\nXerces2 is able to parse documents written according to the XML 1.1\nRecommendation, except that it does not yet provide an option to enable\nnormalization checking as described in section 2.13 of this specification. It\nalso handles name spaces according to the XML Namespaces 1.1 Recommendation,\nand will correctly serialize XML 1.1 documents if the DOM level 3 load/save\nAPIs are in use.\n",
