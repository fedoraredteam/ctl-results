            "Description": "\nThe Extended root file server consists of a file server called xrootd\nand a cluster management server called cmsd.\n\nThe xrootd server was developed for the root analysis framework to\nserve root files. However, the server is agnostic to file types and\nprovides POSIX-like access to any type of file.\n\nThe cmsd server is the next generation version of the olbd server,\noriginally developed to cluster and load balance Objectivity/DB AMS\ndatabase servers. It provides enhanced capability along with lower\nlatency and increased throughput.\n",
