            "Description": "\nXmonad is a tiling window manager for X. Windows are arranged automatically to\ntile the screen without gaps or overlap, maximising screen use. All features of\nthe window manager are accessible from the keyboard: a mouse is strictly\noptional. xmonad is written and extensible in Haskell. Custom layout\nalgorithms, and other extensions, may be written by the user in config files.\nLayouts are applied dynamically, and different layouts may be used on each\nworkspace. Xinerama is fully supported, allowing windows to be tiled on several\nscreens.\n\nThis is a meta-package that installs xmonad-basic and ghc-xmonad-contrib-devel,\nallowing xmonad to be customized with \"~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs\".\n\nTo use xmonad with GNOME/MATE, please install xmonad-mate.\n",
