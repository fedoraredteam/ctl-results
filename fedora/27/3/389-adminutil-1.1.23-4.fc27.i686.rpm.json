The PSET functions allow applications to\nstore their preferences and configuration parameters in LDAP, without\nhaving to know anything about LDAP.  The configuration is cached in a\nlocal file, allowing applications to function even if the LDAP server\nis down.  The other code is typically used by CGI programs used for\ndirectory server management, containing GET/POST processing code as\nwell as resource handling (ICU ures API).\n",
