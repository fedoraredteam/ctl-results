Not any more.\n\nInstall this rule to grant all users read and write access to collected\ndevices based on the VID and PID.\n\nDisclaimer: Such device might not be a 3D printer, it my be an Arduino, it\nmight be a modem and it might even be a blender. But normally you would\nadd your user to dialout and get access to all of those and more anyway.\nSo I guess be careful when some of the users should not get access to\nyour blenders.\n",
