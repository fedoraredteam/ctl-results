TVTK manipulates\nvisualization objects, while Mayavi2 lets you operate on your data,\nand then see the results. Most users either use the Mayavi user\ninterface or program to its scripting interface; you probably don't\nneed to interact with TVTK unless you want to create a new Mayavi\nmodule.\n",
