            "Description": "\n\nOggConvert is a small GNOME utility that uses GStreamer\nto convert media files to the patent-free Theora\nand Vorbis formats. It also supports the Dirac format,\nthrough the schrodinger codec. It's painfully easy to use,\nchanging the quality settings and the output\nfilename is simple. It uses GStreamer, so it can\nconvert (almost) any file which Totem can play.\nIt can deal with audio-only files, video-only files,\nand files with many audio tracks (such as DVD rips with\na commentary track). Thanks to the magic of GStreamer, metadata\n(for example, title and artist info on an MP3) is preserved.\nFinally, it adheres to the GNOME HIG as much as possible.\n",
