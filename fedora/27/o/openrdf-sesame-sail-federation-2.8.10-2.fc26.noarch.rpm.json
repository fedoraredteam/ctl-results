The\nFederation SAIL combines multiple RDF stores that\nmay exist on a remote server or are embedded in the\nsame JVM. The Federation uses query optimizations to\ndistribute sections of the query to different members\nbased on the data contained in each of the members.\nThese results are then joined together within the\nfederation to provide the same result as if all the\ndata was co-located within a single repository\n",
