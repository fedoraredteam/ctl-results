            "Description": "\nobmenu is a graphical menu editor for the Openbox window manager. Openbox uses\nXML to store its menu preferences, and editing these by hand can quickly become\ntedious; and even moreso when generating an entire menu for oneself! However,\nthis utility provides a convenient method of editing the menu in a graphical\ninterface, while not losing the powerful features of Openbox such as its\npipe menus.\n\nThis also provides a Python module named obxml that can be used to further\nscript Openbox's menu system.\n",
