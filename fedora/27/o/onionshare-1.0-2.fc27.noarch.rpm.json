It works\nby starting a web server, making it accessible as a Tor hidden service, and\ngenerating an unguessable URL to access and download files. It doesn't require\nsetting up a server on the internet somewhere or using a third party\nfile sharing service. You host files on your own computer and use a Tor\nhidden service to make it temporarily accessible over the internet. The other\nuser just needs to use Tor Browser to download a file from you.\n",
