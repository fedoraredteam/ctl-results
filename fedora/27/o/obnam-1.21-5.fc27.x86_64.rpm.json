            "Description": "\nObnam is an easy, secure backup program. Backups can be stored on\nlocal hard disks, or online via the SSH SFTP protocol. The backup\nserver, if used, does not require any special software, on top of SSH.\n\nSome features that may interest you:\n\n * Snapshot backups. Every generation looks like a complete snapshot,\n   so you don't need to care about full versus incremental backups, or\n   rotate real or virtual tapes.\n\n * Data de-duplication, across files, and backup generations. If the\n   backup repository already contains a particular chunk of data, it\n   will be re-used, even if it was in another file in an older backup\n   generation. This way, you don't need to worry about moving around\n   large files, or modifying them.\n\n * Encrypted backups, using GnuPG.\n\nObnam can do push or pull backups, depending on what you need. You can\nrun Obnam on the client, and push backups to the server, or on the\nserver, and pull from the client over SFTP. However, access to live\ndata over SFTP is currently somewhat limited and fragile, so it is not\nrecommended.\n",
