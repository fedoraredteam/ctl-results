            "Description": "\nOpenSTV is an open-source software for implementing the single transferable\nvote and other voting methods such as instant runoff voting, Condorcet voting,\nand approval voting. OpenSTV is the only open-source software that implements\nthe single transferable vote exactly as used by governments, including Scotland\nand the City of Cambridge, Massachusetts. These methods have been extensively\nverified against other software and/or actual election results.\n\nOrganizations can use OpenSTV to implement their own elections. First, the\norganization must adopt a voting method. Second, the organization must conduct\nthe vote, and this will most likely be done with paper ballots. Third, the\nballots must be entered into the OpenSTV program. Finally, you can use OpenSTV\nto count the votes and determine the winners of the election.\n",
