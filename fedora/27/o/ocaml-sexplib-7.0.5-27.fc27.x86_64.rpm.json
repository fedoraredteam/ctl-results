            "Description": "\nThis library contains functionality for parsing and pretty-printing\nS-expressions. In addition to that it contains an extremely useful\npreprocessing module for Camlp4, which can be used to automatically\ngenerate code from type definitions for efficiently converting\nOCaml-values to S-expressions and vice versa. In combination with the\nparsing and pretty-printing functionality this frees users from having\nto write their own I/O-routines for datastructures they\ndefine. Possible errors during automatic conversions from\nS-expressions to OCaml-values are reported in a very human-readable\nway. Another module in the library allows you to extract and replace\nsub-expressions in S-expressions.\n",
