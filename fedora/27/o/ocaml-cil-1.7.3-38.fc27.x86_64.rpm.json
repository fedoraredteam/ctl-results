            "Description": "\nCIL (C Intermediate Language) is a high-level representation along\nwith a set of tools that permit easy analysis and source-to-source\ntransformation of C programs.\n\nCIL is both lower-level than abstract-syntax trees, by clarifying\nambiguous constructs and removing redundant ones, and also\nhigher-level than typical intermediate languages designed for\ncompilation, by maintaining types and a close relationship with the\nsource program. The main advantage of CIL is that it compiles all\nvalid C programs into a few core constructs with a very clean\nsemantics. Also CIL has a syntax-directed type system that makes it\neasy to analyze and manipulate C programs. Furthermore, the CIL\nfront-end is able to process not only ANSI-C programs but also those\nusing Microsoft C or GNU C extensions. If you do not use CIL and want\ninstead to use just a C parser and analyze programs expressed as\nabstract-syntax trees then your analysis will have to handle a lot of\nugly corners of the language (let alone the fact that parsing C itself\nis not a trivial task).\n\nIn essence, CIL is a highly-structured, \"clean\" subset of C. CIL\nfeatures a reduced number of syntactic and conceptual forms. For\nexample, all looping constructs are reduced to a single form, all\nfunction bodies are given explicit return statements, syntactic sugar\nlike \"->\" is eliminated and function arguments with array types become\npointers.\n",
