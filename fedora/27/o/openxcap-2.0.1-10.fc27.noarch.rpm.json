An XCAP server is used by SIP SIMPLE clients and\nservers to manage buddy lists and policy for subscriptions to presence or\nother type of events published using SIP protocol.\n\nXCAP protocol allows a client to read, write and modify application\nconfiguration data stored in XML format on a server. XCAP maps XML document\nsub-trees and element attributes to HTTP URIs, so that these components can\nbe directly accessed by HTTP. An XCAP server is used by the XCAP clients to\nstore data like Presence policy in combination with a SIP Presence server\nthat supports PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY methods to provide a complete SIP\nSIMPLE server solution.\n",
