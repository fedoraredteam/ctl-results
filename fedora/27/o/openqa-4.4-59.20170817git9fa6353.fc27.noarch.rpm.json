            "Description": "\nopenQA is a testing framework that allows you to test GUI applications on one\nhand and bootloader and kernel on the other. In both cases, it is difficult to\nscript tests and verify the output. Output can be a popup window or it can be\nan error in early boot even before init is executed.\n\nopenQA is an automated test tool that makes it possible to test the whole\ninstallation process of an operating system. It uses virtual machines to\nreproduce the process, check the output (both serial console and screen) in\nevery step and send the necessary keystrokes and commands to proceed to the\nnext. openQA can check whether the system can be installed, whether it works\nproperly in 'live' mode, whether applications work or whether the system\nresponds as expected to different installation options and commands.\n\nEven more importantly, openQA can run several combinations of tests for every\nrevision of the operating system, reporting the errors detected for each\ncombination of hardware configuration, installation options and variant of the\noperating system.\n",
