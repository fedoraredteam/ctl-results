            "Description": "\nFaCiLe is a constraint programming library on integer and integer set finite\ndomains written in OCaml. It offers all usual facilities to create and\nmanipulate finite domain variables, arithmetic expressions and constraints\n(possibly non-linear), built-in global constraints (difference, cardinality,\nsorting etc.) and search and optimization goals. FaCiLe allows as well to build\neasily user-defined constraints and goals (including recursive ones), making\npervasive use of OCaml higher-order functionals to provide a simple and flexible\ninterface for the user. As FaCiLe is an OCaml library and not \"yet another\nlanguage\", the user benefits from type inference and strong typing discipline,\nhigh level of abstraction, modules and objects system, as well as native code\ncompilation efficiency, garbage collection and replay debugger, all features of\nOCaml (among many others) that allow to prototype and experiment quickly:\nmodeling, data processing and interface are implemented with the same powerful\nand efficient language.\n",
