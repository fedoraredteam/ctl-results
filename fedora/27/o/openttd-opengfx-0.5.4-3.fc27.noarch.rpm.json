            "Description": "\nOpenGFX is an open source graphics base set for OpenTTD which can completely\nreplace the TTD base set. The main goal of OpenGFX therefore is to provide a\nset of free base graphics which make it possible to play OpenTTD without\nrequiring the (copyrighted) files from the TTD CD. This potentially increases\nthe OpenTTD fan base and makes it a true free game (with \"free\" as in both\n\"free beer\" and \"free speech\").\n\nAs of version 0.2.0 OpenGFX has a full set of sprites. Future versions will aim\nto improve the graphics.\n",
