            "Description": "\nBiCePS is one of the libraries that make up the CHiPPS (COIN High Performance\nParallel Search Framework) library hierarchy. It implements that data-handling\nfunctions needed to support development of many types of relaxation-based\nbranch-and-bound algorithms, especially for solving mathematical programs. It\nis intended to capture the implementation of methods common to all such\nalgorithms without assuming anything about the structure of the mathematical\nprogram or the bounding method used. BLIS, which is another layer built on top\nof BiCePS, is a concretization of Bcps for the case of mixed integer linear\nprograms. DIP is another implementation being developed using BLIS that\nimplements a decomposition-based bounding procedure.\n",
