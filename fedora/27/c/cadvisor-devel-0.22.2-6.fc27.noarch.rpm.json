Specifically, for each container it keeps\nresource isolation parameters, historical resource usage, histograms of\ncomplete historical resource usage and network statistics. This data is\nexported by container and machine-wide.\n\ncAdvisor currently supports lmctfy containers as well as Docker containers\n(those that use the default libcontainer execdriver). Other container backends\ncan also be added. cAdvisor's container abstraction is based on lmctfy's\nso containers are inherently nested hierarchically.\n\nThis package contains library source intended for\nbuilding other packages which use import path with\ngithub.com/google/cadvisor prefix.\n",
