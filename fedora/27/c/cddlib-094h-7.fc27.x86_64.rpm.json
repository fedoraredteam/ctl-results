            "Description": "\nThe C-library cddlib is a C implementation of the Double Description\nMethod of Motzkin et al. for generating all vertices (i.e. extreme points)\nand extreme rays of a general convex polyhedron in R^d given by a system\nof linear inequalities:\n\n   P = { x=(x1, ..., xd)^T :  b - A  x  >= 0 }\n\nwhere A is a given m x d real matrix, b is a given m-vector\nand 0 is the m-vector of all zeros.\n\nThe program can be used for the reverse operation (i.e. convex hull\ncomputation). This means that one can move back and forth between\nan inequality representation and a generator (i.e. vertex and ray)\nrepresentation of a polyhedron with cdd. Also, cdd can solve a linear\nprogramming problem, i.e. a problem of maximizing and minimizing\na linear function over P.\n",
