Sets of definitions and theorems can be saved as compiled\nmodules and loaded into the system.\n\nThis package provides documentation and tutorials for the system. The\nmain documentation comes in two parts: the main Library documentation,\nwhich describes all Coq.* modules, and the Reference Manual, which\ngives a more complete description of the whole system. Included are\nalso HTML versions of both. Furthermore, there are two tutorials, the\nmain one, and one specifically on recursive types. The example code\nfor the latter is also included.\n",
