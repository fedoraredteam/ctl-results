            "Description": "\nAn open source algebraic modelling language implemented as a C++ class\nlibrary.\n\nUsing FLOPC++, linear optimization models can be specified in a declarative\nstyle, similar to algebraic modelling languages such as GAMS and AMPL,\nwithin a C++ program. As a result the traditional strengths of algebraic\nmodelling languages are preserved, while embedding linear optimization\nmodels in software applications is facilitated.\n\nFLOPC++ can be used as a substitute for traditional modelling languages,\nwhen modelling linear optimization problems, but its principal strength\nlies in the fact that the modelling facilities are combined with a\npowerful general purpose programming language. This combination is\nessential for implementing efficient algorithms (using linear optimization\nfor subproblems), integrating optimization models in user applications, etc.\n",
