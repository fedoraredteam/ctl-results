            "Description": "\nCHiPPS is the COIN-OR High-Performance Parallel Search Framework, a framework\nfor implementing parallel algorithms based on tree search. The current CHiPPS\narchitecture consists of three layers. The Abstract Library for Parallel Search\n(ALPS) is the base layer of a hierarchy consisting of implementations of\nvarious tree search algorithms for specific problem types. The Branch,\nConstrain, and Price Software (BiCePS) is a data management layer built on\ntop of ALPS for implementing relaxation-based branch and bound algorithms.\nThe BiCePS Linear Integer Solver (BLIS) is a concretization of the BiCePS\nlayer for solving mixed-integer linear programs. ALPS, BiCePS, and BLIS\nare sub-repostories of the CHiPPS Subversion repository.\n",
