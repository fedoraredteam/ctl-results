            "Description": "\nThe Crypto Bone is a secure messaging system that makes sure a user's\nemail is always encrypted without burdening the user with the message\nkey management. Based on a GUI and a separate daemon, both ease-of-use\nand security are assured by a novel approach to encryption key management.\n\nWhile the message keys are secured by a daemon running on the Linux machine,\nadditional protection can be achieved by using an external device for storing\nencryption keys. This external device can be another Linux computer dedicated\nto this task or a Beagle Bone or a Raspberry Pi.  (https://crypto-bone.com)\n",
