It is ideal for\nwriting data import programs or analyzing log files.\n\nThe driver enables a directory or a ZIP file containing CSV or DBF files\nto be accessed as though it were a database containing tables. However,\nas there is no real database management system behind the scenes,\nnot all JDBC functionality is available.\n",
