            "Description": "\nA Cache is similar to ConcurrentMap, but not quite the same. The most\nfundamental difference is that a ConcurrentMap persists all elements that are\nadded to it until they are explicitly removed. A Cache on the other hand is\ngenerally configured to evict entries automatically, in order to constrain its\nmemory footprint. In some cases a LoadingCache or AsyncLoadingCache can be\nuseful even if it doesn't evict entries, due to its automatic cache loading.\n\nCaffeine provide flexible construction to create a cache with a combination\nof the following features:\nautomatic loading of entries into the cache, optionally asynchronously\nsize-based eviction when a maximum is exceeded based on frequency and recency\ntime-based expiration of entries, measured since last access or last write\nasynchronously refresh when the first stale request for an entry occurs\nkeys automatically wrapped in weak references\nvalues automatically wrapped in weak or soft references\nnotification of evicted (or otherwise removed) entries\nwrites propagated to an external resource\naccumulation of cache access statistics\n",
