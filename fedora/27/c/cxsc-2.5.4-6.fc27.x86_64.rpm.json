            "Description": "\nC-XSC is the C language variant of the XSC (eXtensions for Scientific\nComputing) project.  It provides routines that guarantee accuracy and\nreliability of results.  Problem-solving routines with automatic result\nverification have been developed for many standard problems of numerical\nanalysis, such as linear or nonlinear systems of equations, differential\nand integral equations, etc. as well as for a large number of\napplications in engineering and the natural sciences.  Some of the\nfeatures of C-XSC are:\n- Operator concept (user-defined operators)\n- Overloading concept\n- Module concept\n- Dynamic arrays\n- Controlled rounding\n- Predefined arithmetic data types real, extended real, complex,\n  interval, complex interval, and corresponding vector and matrix types\n- Predefined arithmetic operators and elementary functions of the highest\n  accuracy for the arithmetic data types\n- Data type dotprecision for the exact representation of dot products\n- Library of mathematical problem-solving routines with automatic result\n  verification and high accuracy\n",
