            "Description": "\nSYMPHONY is an open-source solver for mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs)\nwritten in C. It can be used in three different main modes:\n\n  * As a callable library through either the native C interface or through\n    the Osi.\n  * As an interactive solver using a command-line interface.\n  * As a framework to build customized solvers for specific problem classes.\n\nSYMPHONY can be executed in either parallel (distributed or shared memory)\nor sequential modes and has a number of advanced features that make it unique,\nincluding the ability to\n\n  * solve biobjective MILPs,\n  * warm start the solution procedure, and\n  * perform basic sensitivity analyses.\n\nSYMPHONY links to a number of other COIN projects for additional\nfunctionality, including:\n\n   * Clp (the default solver for LP relaxations)\n   * Osi (an interface to alternative solvers for solving LP relaxations)\n   * Cgl (for cut generation)\n   * CoinUtils (for reading in MPS files and various utilities)\n",
