Instead of compiling\nfrom a source language to machine code, it compiles from JavaScript to\nbetter JavaScript. It parses your JavaScript, analyzes it, removes\ndead code and rewrites and minimizes what\u2019s left. It also checks\nsyntax, variable references, and types, and warns about common\nJavaScript pitfalls.\n",
