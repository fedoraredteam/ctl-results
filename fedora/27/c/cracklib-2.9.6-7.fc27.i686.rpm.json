CrackLib performs\nseveral tests on passwords: it tries to generate words from a username\nand gecos entry and checks those words against the password; it checks\nfor simplistic patterns in passwords; and it checks for the password\nin a dictionary.\n\nCrackLib is actually a library containing a particular C function\nwhich is used to check the password, as well as other C\nfunctions. CrackLib is not a replacement for a passwd program; it must\nbe used in conjunction with an existing passwd program.\n\nInstall the cracklib package if you need a program to check users'\npasswords to see if they are at least minimally secure. If you install\nCrackLib, you will also want to install the cracklib-dicts package.\n",
