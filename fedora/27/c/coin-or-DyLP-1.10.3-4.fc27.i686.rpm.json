            "Description": "\nDyLP is an implementation of the dynamic simplex algorithm. Briefly, dynamic\nsimplex attempts to work with an active constraint system which is a subset\nof the full constraint system. It alternates between primal and dual simplex\nphases. Between simplex phases, it deactivates variables and constraints\nwhich are not currently useful, and scans the full constraint system to\nactivate variables and constraints which have become useful.\n",
