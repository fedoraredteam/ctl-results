Cleanfeed\nlooks for duplicated messages, repeated patterns, and known spamming\nsites and domains.  It can be configured to block binary posts to\nnon-binary newsgroups, to cancel already-rejected articles, and to\nreject some spamming from local users.\n\nInstall the cleanfeed package if you need a spam filter for a Usenet\nnews server.\n",
