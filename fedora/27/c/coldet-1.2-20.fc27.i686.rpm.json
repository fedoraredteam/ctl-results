Its purpose is mainly for 3D games where accurate detection\nis needed between two non-simple objects.\n\nFeatures:\n    * Works on any model, even polygon soups.\n    * Uses bounding box hierarchies for fast detection.\n    * Uses additional triangle intersection tests for 100% accuracy.\n    * Provides (upon request) exact point of collision, plus the pair of\n      triangles that collided.\n    * Supports timeout setting, to limit detection time.\n    * Model-Model collision test.\n    * Ray-Model collision test.\n    * Segment-Model collision test.\n    * Sphere-Model collision test.\n    * Ray-Sphere and Sphere-Sphere primitive collision tests.\n",
