            "Description": "\nVol (Volume Algorithm) is an open-source implementation of a subgradient\nmethod that produces primal as well as dual solutions. The primal solution\ncomes from estimating the volumes below the faces of the dual problem. This\nis an approximate method so the primal vector might have small infeasiblities\nthat are negligible in many practical settings. The original subgradient\nalgorithm produces only dual solutions.\n",
