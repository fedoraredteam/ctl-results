            "Description": "\nModern Linux distributions offer some mitigation techniques to make it harder\nto exploit software vulnerabilities reliably. Mitigations such as RELRO,\nNoExecute (NX), Stack Canaries, Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and\nPosition Independent Executables (PIE) have made reliably exploiting any\nvulnerabilities that do exist far more challenging. The checksec script is\ndesigned to test what *standard* Linux OS and PaX (http://pax.grsecurity.net/)\nsecurity features are being used.\n\nAs of version 1.3 the script also lists the status of various Linux kernel\nprotection mechanisms.\n\nchecksec can check binary-files and running processes for hardening features.\n",
