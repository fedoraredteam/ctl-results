CFITSIO\nsimplifies the task of writing software that deals with FITS files by\nproviding an easy to use set of high-level routines that insulate the\nprogrammer from the internal complexities of the FITS file format. At the\nsame time, CFITSIO provides many advanced features that have made it the\nmost widely used FITS file programming interface in the astronomical\ncommunity.\n",
