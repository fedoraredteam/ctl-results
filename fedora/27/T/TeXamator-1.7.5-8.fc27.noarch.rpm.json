Basically, it browses a specified directory, looks for .tex\nfiles containing exercises and builds a tree with all your exercises in it. You\ncan click on an element of the tree to have a preview of the exercise and add\nit to a list if you wish to. Then you can save your work to a .tex file or you\ncan generate a .dvi file.\n",
