It is specially designed to allow you to\nwrite extension modules for Python that have the speed of C and the\nsimplicity and readability of Python.  You write your code in a Python-like\nlanguage with C-typed variables, then use the pyrexc compiler to transform\nit into a C representation.  This is useful for speeding up critical sections\nof your Python code or wrapping an external library.\n\nPlease see the documentation for how to get the best performance from your\ncode.\n",
