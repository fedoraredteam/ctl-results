Perlbal can act as either a web\nserver or a reverse proxy.\n\nOne of the defining things about Perlbal is that almost everything can be\nconfigured or reconfigured on the fly without needing to restart the software.\nA basic configuration file containing a management port enables you to easily\nperform operations on a running instance of Perlbal.\n\nPerlbal can also be extended by means of per-service (and global) plugins that\ncan override many parts of request handling and behavior.\n",
