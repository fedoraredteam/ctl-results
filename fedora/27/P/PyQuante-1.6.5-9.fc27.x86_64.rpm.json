            "Description": "\nPyQuante is an open-source suite of programs for developing quantum chemistry\nmethods. The program is written in the Python programming language, but has\nmany \"rate-determining\" modules also written in C for speed. The resulting\ncode, though not as fast as Jaguar, NWChem, Gaussian, or GAMESS, is much\neasier to understand and modify. The goal of this software is not necessarily\nto provide a working quantum chemistry program (although it will hopefully do\nthat), but rather to provide a well-engineered set of tools so that scientists\ncan construct their own quantum chemistry programs without going through the\ntedium of having to write every low-level routine.\n\nYou might want to install PyQuante-libint as well, which speeds up the\ncalculation of two-electron integrals.\n",
