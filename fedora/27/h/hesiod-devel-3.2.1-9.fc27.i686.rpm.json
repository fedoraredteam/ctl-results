It is often used to\ndistribute information which might otherwise kept in the /etc/passwd,\n/etc/group, and /etc/printcap files over a network, eliminating the need to\nensure the files are synchronized among multiple hosts.  This package contains\nthe header files and libraries required for building programs which use Hesiod.\n",
