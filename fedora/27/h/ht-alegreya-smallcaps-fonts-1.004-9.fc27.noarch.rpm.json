            "Description": "\n\nAlegreya was chosen as one of 53 \"Fonts of the Decade\" at the ATypI Letter2\ncompetition in September 2011, and one of the top 14 text type systems. It\nwas also selected in the 2nd Bienal Iberoamericana de Dise\u00f1o, competition\nheld in Madrid in 2010. Alegreya is a typeface originally intended for\nliterature. Among its crowning characteristics, it conveys a dynamic and\nvaried rhythm which facilitates the reading of long texts. Also, it\nprovides freshness to the page while referring to the calligraphic letter,\nnot as a literal interpretation, but rather in a contemporary typographic\nlanguage. The italic has just as much care and attention to detail in the\ndesign as the roman. The bold weights are strong, and the Black weights are\nreally experimental for the genre. Not only does Alegreya provide great\nperformance, but also achieves a strong and harmonious text by means of\nelements designed in an atmosphere of diversity.\n\nThis is the SmallCaps variant, in which the Capital letters are smaller.\n",
