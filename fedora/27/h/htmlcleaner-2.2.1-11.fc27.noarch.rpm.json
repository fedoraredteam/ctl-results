HTML found on Web is\nusually dirty, ill-formed and unsuitable for further processing.\nFor any serious consumption of such documents, it is necessary to first\nclean up the mess and bring the order to tags, attributes and ordinary text.\nFor the given HTML document, HtmlCleaner reorders individual elements and\nproduces well-formed XML. By default, it follows similar rules that the most\nof web browsers use in order to create Document Object Model. However, user\nmay provide custom tag and rule set for tag filtering and balancing.\n",
