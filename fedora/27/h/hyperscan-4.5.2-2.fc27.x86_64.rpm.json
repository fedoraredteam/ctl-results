It\nfollows the regular expression syntax of the commonly-used libpcre\nlibrary, but is a standalone library with its own C API.\n\nHyperscan uses hybrid automata techniques to allow simultaneous\nmatching of large numbers (up to tens of thousands) of regular\nexpressions and for the matching of regular expressions across streams\nof data.\n\nHyperscan is typically used in a DPI library stack.\n",
