            "Description": "\nHSQLdb is a relational database engine written in JavaTM , with a JDBC\ndriver, supporting a subset of ANSI-92 SQL. It offers a small (about\n100k), fast database engine which offers both in memory and disk based\ntables. Embedded and server modes are available. Additionally, it\nincludes tools such as a minimal web server, in-memory query and\nmanagement tools (can be run as applets or servlets, too) and a number\nof demonstration examples.\nDownloaded code should be regarded as being of production quality. The\nproduct is currently being used as a database and persistence engine in\nmany Open Source Software projects and even in commercial projects and\nproducts! In it's current version it is extremely stable and reliable.\nIt is best known for its small size, ability to execute completely in\nmemory and its speed. Yet it is a completely functional relational\ndatabase management system that is completely free under the Modified\nBSD License. Yes, that's right, completely free of cost or restrictions!\n",
