It is a shame that the Java SDK did not come with\na built in class that was just simply a byte[], int offset,\nint length class which provided a rich interface similar to\nwhat the String class does for char arrays. This library\nfills in that void by providing a Buffer class which does provide\nthat rich interface.\n",
