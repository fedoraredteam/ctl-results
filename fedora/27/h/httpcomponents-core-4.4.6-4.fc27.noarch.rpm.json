            "Description": "\nHttpCore is a set of low level HTTP transport components that can be\nused to build custom client and server side HTTP services with a\nminimal footprint. HttpCore supports two I/O models: blocking I/O\nmodel based on the classic Java I/O and non-blocking, event driven I/O\nmodel based on Java NIO.\n\nThe blocking I/O model may be more appropriate for data intensive, low\nlatency scenarios, whereas the non-blocking model may be more\nappropriate for high latency scenarios where raw data throughput is\nless important than the ability to handle thousands of simultaneous\nHTTP connections in a resource efficient manner.\n",
