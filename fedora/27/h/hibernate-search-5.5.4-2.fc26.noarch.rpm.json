However, Lucene\nsuffers several mismatches when dealing with object domain models. Amongst\nother things indexes have to be kept up to date and mismatches between index\nstructure and domain model as well as query mismatches have to be avoided.\n\nHibernate Search addresses these shortcomings - it indexes your domain model\nwith the help of a few annotations, takes care of database/index\nsynchronization and brings back regular managed objects from free text queries.\n\nHibernate Search is using Apache Lucene under the cover.\n",
