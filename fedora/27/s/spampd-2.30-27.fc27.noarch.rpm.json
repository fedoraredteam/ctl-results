            "Description": "\nSpampd is a program used within an e-mail delivery system to scan messages for\npossible Unsolicited Commercial E-mail (UCE, aka spam) content. It uses\nSpamAssassin (SA) to do the actual message scanning. Spampd acts as a\ntransparent SMTP/LMTP proxy between two mail servers, and during the\ntransaction it passes the mail through SA. If SA decides the mail could be\nspam, then spampd will ask SA to add some headers and a report to the message\nindicating it's spam and why.\n",
