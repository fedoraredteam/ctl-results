            "Description": "\nCharis SIL provides glyphs for a wide range of Latin and Cyrillic characters.\nCharis is similar to Bitstream Charter, one of the first fonts designed\nspecifically for laser printers. It is highly readable and holds up well in\nless-than-ideal reproduction environments. It also has a full set of styles\n\u2014 regular, italic, bold, bold italic \u2014 and so is more useful in general\npublishing than Doulos SIL. Charis is a serif proportionally spaced font\noptimized for readability in long printed documents.\n\nThe Charis SIL Compact fonts were derived from Charis SIL using SIL TypeTuner,\nby setting the \u201cLine spacing\u201d feature to \u201cTight\u201d, and they cannot be TypeTuned\nagain. They may exhibit some diacritics clipping on screen (but should print\nfine).\n",
