            "Description": "\nThis package contains very detailed documentation,\nand some great examples for shogun.\n\n\nThe Shogun Machine learning toolbox provides a wide range of unified and\nefficient Machine Learning (ML) methods.  The toolbox seamlessly allows to\neasily combine multiple data representations, algorithm classes, and general\npurpose tools.  This enables both rapid prototyping of data pipelines and\nextensibility in terms of new algorithms.  We combine modern software\narchitecture in C++ with both efficient low-level computing back-ends and\ncutting edge algorithm implementations to solve large-scale Machine Learning\nproblems (yet) on single machines.\n\nOne of Shogun's most exciting features is that you can use the toolbox through\na unified interface from C++, Python(3), Octave, R, Java, Lua, etc.  This not\njust means that we are independent of trends in computing languages, but it\nalso lets you use Shogun as a vehicle to expose your algorithm to multiple\ncommunities.  We use SWIG to enable bidirectional communication between C++\nand target languages.  Shogun runs under Linux/Unix, MacOS, Windows.\n\nOriginally focusing on large-scale kernel methods and bioinformatics (for a\nlist of scientific papers mentioning Shogun, see here), the toolbox saw\nmassive extensions to other fields in recent years.  It now offers features\nthat span the whole space of Machine Learning methods, including many\nclassical methods in classification, regression, dimensionality reduction,\nclustering, but also more advanced algorithm classes such as metric,\nmulti-task, structured output, and online learning, as well as feature\nhashing, ensemble methods, and optimization, just to name a few.  Shogun in\naddition contains a number of exclusive state-of-the art algorithms such as\na wealth of efficient SVM implementations, Multiple Kernel Learning, kernel\nhypothesis testing, Krylov methods, etc.  All algorithms are supported by a\ncollection of general purpose methods for evaluation, parameter tuning,\npreprocessing, serialization & I/O, etc;  the resulting combinatorial\npossibilities are huge.\n\nThe wealth of ML open-source software allows us to offer bindings to other\nsophisticated libraries including:  LibSVM, LibLinear, LibOCAS, libqp,\nVowpalWabbit, Tapkee, SLEP, GPML and more.\n\nShogun got initiated in 1999 by Soeren Sonnenburg and Gunnar Raetsch (that's\nwhere the name ShoGun originates from).  It is now developed by a larger team\nof authors, and would not have been possible without the patches and bug\nreports by various people.  See contributions for a detailed list.  Statistics\non Shogun's development activity can be found on ohloh.\n",
