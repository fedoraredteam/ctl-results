The focus is\non clear, easy-to-perceive letterforms that will not be readily confused with\none another.\n\nA sans serif font is preferred by some literacy personnel for teaching people\nto read. Its forms are simpler and less cluttered than those of most serif\nfonts. For years, literacy workers have had to make do with fonts that were\nnot really suitable for beginning readers and writers. In some cases, literacy\nspecialists have had to tediously assemble letters from a variety of fonts in\norder to get all of the characters they need for their particular language\nproject, resulting in confusing and unattractive publications. Andika\naddresses those issues.\n",
