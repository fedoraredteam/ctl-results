It reclaims\ngoogle, altavista, babelfish, dejanews, freshmeat, research index,\nslashdot and many others from the false-prophet, pox-infested heathen\nlands of html-forms, placing these wonders where they belong, deep in\nunix heartland, as god loving extensions to the shell.\n\nSurfraw abstracts the browser away from input. Doing so lets it get on\nwith what it's good at. Browsing. Interpretation of linguistic forms\nis handed back to the shell, which is what it, and human beings are\ngood at. Combined with netscape-remote or incremental text browsers,\nsuch as links (http://artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~mikulas/links/), w3m\n(http://www.w3m.org/), and screen(1) a Surfraw liberateur is capable\nof navigating speeds that leave GUI tainted idolaters agape with fear\nand wonder.\n",
