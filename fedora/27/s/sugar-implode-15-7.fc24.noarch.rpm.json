            "Description": "\nImplode is a logic game based on the \"falling block\" model of Tetris. The game\nstarts with a grid partially filled with blocks. The player makes a move by\nremoving adjacent blocks of the same color in groups of three or more. When\nblocks are removed, higher blocks fall to fill their space, and when a column\nis cleared, the blocks on either side close to fill the gap. The object of the\ngame is to remove all the blocks. Since the patterns of blocks above changes\nwhen lower blocks are removed, the player must carefully decide what order\nin which to remove the blocks so that there are no isolated blocks left at\nthe end of the game. The levels are generated in such a way that there is\nalways a sequence of removals that clears the board.\n",
