            "Description": "\n\nSBinary is a library for describing binary protocols, in the form of\nmappings between Scala types and binary formats. It can be used as a\nrobust serialization mechanism for Scala objects or a way of dealing\nwith existing binary formats found in the wild.\n\nIt started out life as a loose port of Haskell's Data.Binary. It's\nsince evolved a bit from there to take advantage of the features Scala\nimplicits offer over Haskell type classes, but the core idea has\nremained the same.\n",
