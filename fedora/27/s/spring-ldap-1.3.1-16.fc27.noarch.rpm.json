            "Description": "\nSpring LDAP is a Java library for simplifying LDAP operations, based on the\npattern of Spring's JdbcTemplate. The framework relieves the user of common\nchores, such as looking up and closing contexts, looping through results,\nencoding/decoding values and filters, and more. The LdapTemplate class\nencapsulates all the plumbing work involved in traditional LDAP programming,\nsuch as creating a DirContext, looping through NamingEnumerations, handling\nexceptions and cleaning up resources. This leaves the programmer to handle the\nimportant stuff - where to find data (DNs and Filters) and what do do with it\n(map to and from domain objects, bind, modify, unbind, etc.), in the same way\nthat JdbcTemplate relieves the programmer of all but the actual SQL and how the\ndata maps to the domain model. In addition to this, Spring LDAP provides\ntransaction support, a pooling library, exception translation from\nNamingExceptions to a mirrored unchecked Exception hierarchy, as well as\nseveral utilities for working with filters, LDAP paths and Attributes.\n",
