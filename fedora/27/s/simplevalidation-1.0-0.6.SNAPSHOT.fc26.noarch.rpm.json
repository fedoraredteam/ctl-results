            "Description": "\nThis is a simple library for quickly adding validation code to Swing\nuser-interfaces. It handles validating user input when the user changes a\ncomponent's value, showing error messages and decorating components to\nindicate which component is the source of the problem. It contains a large\nnumber of built-in validators to handle most common situations, such as\nvalidating numbers, email addresses, urls and so forth.\n\nThe primary goal is to make it easy to retrofit validation code on existing\nUIs without needing to rewrite anything or add more than a few lines of code.\n",
