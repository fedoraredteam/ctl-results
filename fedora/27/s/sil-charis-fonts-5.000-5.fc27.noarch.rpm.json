            "Description": "\nCharis SIL provides glyphs for a wide range of Latin and Cyrillic characters.\nCharis is similar to Bitstream Charter, one of the first fonts designed\nspecifically for laser printers. It is highly readable and holds up well in\nless-than-ideal reproduction environments. It also has a full set of styles\n\u2014 regular, italic, bold, bold italic \u2014 and so is more useful in general\npublishing than Doulos SIL. Charis is a serif proportionally spaced font\noptimized for readability in long printed documents.\n",
