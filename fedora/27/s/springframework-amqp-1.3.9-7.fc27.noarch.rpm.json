            "Description": "\nThe Spring AMQP project applies core Spring concepts to the\ndevelopment of AMQP-based messaging solutions. It provides\na \"template\" as a high-level abstraction for sending and\nreceiving messages. It also provides support for Message\ndriven POJOs with a \"listener container\". These libraries\nfacilitate management of AMQP resources while promoting the\nuse of dependency injection and declarative configuration.\nIn all of these cases, you will see similarities to the\nJMS support in the Spring Framework.\n",
