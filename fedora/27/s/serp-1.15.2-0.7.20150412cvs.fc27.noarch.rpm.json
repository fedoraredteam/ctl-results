            "Description": "\nThe goal of the serp byte-code framework is to tap the full\npower of byte-code modification while lowering its associated\ncosts. The framework provides a set of high-level APIs for\nmanipulating all aspects of byte-code, from large-scale\nstructures like class member fields to the individual\ninstructions that comprise the code of methods. While in\norder to perform any advanced manipulation, some understanding\nof the class file format and especially of the JVM instruction\nset is necessary, the framework makes it as easy as possible\nto enter the world of byte-code development.\n",
