            "Description": "\nSimple-JNDI is intended to solve two problems. The first is\nthat of finding a container independent way of opening a\ndatabase connection, the second is to find a good way of\nspecifying application configurations.\n1. Unit tests or prototype code often need to emulate the\n  environment within which the code is expected to run.\n  A very common one is to get an object of type\n  javax.sql.DataSource from JNDI so a java.sql.Connection\n  to your database of choice may be opened.\n2. Applications need configuration; a JNDI implementation\n  makes a handy location for configuration values. Either\n  as a globally available system, or via IoC through the\n  use of some kind of JNDI configuration facade (see gj-config).\nA solution: simple implementation of JNDI. It is entirely\nlibrary based, so no server instances are started, and it\nsits upon Java .properties files, XML files or Windows-style\n.ini files, so it is easy to use and simple to understand.\nThe files may be either on the file system or in the classpath.\n",
