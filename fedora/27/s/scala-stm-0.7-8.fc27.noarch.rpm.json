            "Description": "\nScalaSTM is a lightweight software transactional memory\nfor Scala, inspired by the STMs in Haskell and Clojure.\n\nScalaSTM provides a mutable cell called a Ref. If you\nbuild a shared data structure using immutable objects and\nRef-s, then you can access it from multiple threads or\nactors. No synchronized, no deadlocks or race conditions,\nand good scalability. Included are concurrent sets and\nmaps, and we also have an easier and safer replacement\nfor wait and notifyAll.\n",
