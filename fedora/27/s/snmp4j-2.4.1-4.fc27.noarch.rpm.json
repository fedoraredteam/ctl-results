SNMP4J supports command generation (managers) as\nwell as command responding (agents). Its clean object\noriented design is inspired by SNMP++, which is a\nwell-known SNMPv1/v2c/v3 API for C++ (see http://www.agentpp.com).\n\nThe SNMP4J Java SNMP API provides the following features:\n\n* SNMPv3 with MD5 and SHA authentication and DES, 3DES,\n  AES 128, AES 192, and AES 256 privacy.\n* Pluggable Message Processing Models with implementations\n  for MPv1, MPv2c, and MPv3\n* All PDU types.\n* Pluggable transport mappings. UDP, TCP, and TLS are supported\n  out-of-the-box.\n* Pluggable timeout model.\n* Synchronous and asynchronous requests.\n* Command generator as well as command res-ponder support.\n* Free open source with the Apache license model\n* Java 1.4.1 or later (1.6 for version 2.0 or later)\n* Logging based on Log4J\n* Row-based efficient asynchronous table retrieval with GETBULK.\n* Multi-threading support.\n",
