The goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font\nthat would contain all Lepcha characters. In addition, there is provision for\nother Latin characters and symbols. This font makes use of state-of-the-art\nfont technologies (Graphite and OpenType) to support the need for conjuncts\nand to position arbitrary combinations of Lepcha glyphs and combining marks\noptimally.\n",
