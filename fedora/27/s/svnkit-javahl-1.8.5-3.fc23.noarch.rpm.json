This SVNClient  also implements\nSVNClientInterface (org.tigris.subversion.javahl) as the native one\nbut uses only the SVNKit library API (written in pure Java!).\nIf you have code written with using the native SVNClient class,\nyou may simply replace that class with the new one provided by SVNKit.\n",
