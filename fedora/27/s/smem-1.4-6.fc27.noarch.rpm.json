            "Description": "\nsmem is a tool that can give numerous reports on memory usage on Linux\nsystems. Unlike existing tools, smem can report proportional set size (PSS),\nwhich is a more meaningful representation of the amount of memory used by\nlibraries and applications in a virtual memory system.\n\nBecause large portions of physical memory are typically shared among\nmultiple applications, the standard measure of memory usage known as\nresident set size (RSS) will significantly overestimate memory usage. PSS\ninstead measures each application's \"fair share\" of each shared area to give\na realistic measure.\n",
