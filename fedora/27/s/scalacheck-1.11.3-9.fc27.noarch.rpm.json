            "Description": "\nScalaCheck is a library written in Scala and used for automated\nproperty-based testing of Scala or Java programs. ScalaCheck was\noriginally inspired by the Haskell library QuickCheck, but has also\nventured into its own.\n\nScalaCheck has no external dependencies other than the Scala runtime,\nand works great with sbt, the Scala build tool. It is also fully\nintegrated in the test frameworks ScalaTest and specs2. You can of\ncourse also use ScalaCheck completely standalone, with its built-in\ntest runner.\n",
