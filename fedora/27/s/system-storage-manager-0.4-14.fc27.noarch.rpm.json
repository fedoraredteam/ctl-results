            "Description": "\nSystem Storage Manager provides an easy to use command line interface to manage\nyour storage using various technologies like lvm, btrfs, encrypted volumes and\nmore.\n\nIn more sophisticated enterprise storage environments, management with Device\nMapper (dm), Logical Volume Manager (LVM), or Multiple Devices (md) is becoming\nincreasingly more difficult.  With file systems added to the mix, the number of\ntools needed to configure and manage storage has grown so large that it is\nsimply not user friendly.  With so many options for a system administrator to\nconsider, the opportunity for errors and problems is large.\n\nThe btrfs administration tools have shown us that storage management can be\nsimplified, and we are working to bring that ease of use to Linux file systems\nin general.\n\nYou should install the ssm if you need to manage your storage with various\ntechnologies via a single unified interface.\n",
