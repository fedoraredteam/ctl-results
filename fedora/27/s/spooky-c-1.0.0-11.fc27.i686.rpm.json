The only advantage over\nBob's original version is that it is in C, not C++ and comes with some\ntest and benchmark code.\n\nThis is a very competitive hash function, but is somewhat non-portable.\nIt should work on both big and little endian architectures, but will\ngenerate different hashes on them. It's also optimized for 64-bit\narchitectures. It will work on 32-bit architectures as well, but is much\nslower there.\n",
