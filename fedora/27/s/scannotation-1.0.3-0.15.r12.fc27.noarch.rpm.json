            "Description": "\nScannotation is a Java library that creates an annotation database\nfrom a set of .class files.This database is really just a set of maps that index\nwhat annotations are used and what classes are using them. Why do you need this?\nWhat if you are an annotation framework like an EJB 3.0 container and you want\nto automatically scan your classpath for EJB annotations so that you know what\nto deploy? Scannotation gives you apis that allow you to find archives in your\nclasspath or WAR (web application) that you want to scan, then automatically\nscans them without loading each and every class within those archives\n",
