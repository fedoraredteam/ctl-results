Therefore, if you save a file,\nsyncthing-inotify will know about it and pass this information to\nSyncthing such that near real-time synchronisation can be achieved.\n\nThis package contains the syncthing-inotify source files, which are\nneeded as dependency for building packages using syncthing-inotify.\n",
