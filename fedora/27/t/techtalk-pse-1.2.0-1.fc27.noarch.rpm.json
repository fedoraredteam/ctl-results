It is\ndesigned to be simple to use (for people who know how to use an editor and the\ncommand line) and powerful, so that you can create informative, technically\naccurate and entertaining talks and demonstrations.\n\nTech Talk PSE is good at opening editors at the right place, opening shell\nprompts with preloaded history, compiling and running things during the\ndemonstration, displaying text, photos, figures and video.\n\nTech Talk PSE is bad at slide effects, chart junk and bullet points.\n",
