It is an (as yet unfinished) alternative\nto the ltxdoc class and the doc or xdoc packages. The aim is to\nprovide a different layout and more modern styles (using the\nxcolor, hyperref packages, etc.) This is an alpha release, and\nshould probably not (yet) be used with other packages, since\nthe implementation might change. Nevertheless, the author uses\nit to document his own packages.\n",
