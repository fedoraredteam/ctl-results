A TeX source document specifies or incorporates a\nnumber of macro definitions that instruct the TeX engine how to\ntypeset the document. The TeX engine also uses font metrics\ngenerated by Metafont, or by any of several other mechanisms\nthat incorporate fonts from other sources into an environment\nsuitable for TeX. TeX has been, and continues, a basis and an\ninspiration for several other programs, including e-TeX and\nPDFTeX. The distribution includes the source of Knuth's TeX\nbook; this source is there to read, as an example of writing\nTeX -- it should not be processed without Knuth's direct\npermission.\n",
