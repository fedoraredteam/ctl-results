You install torbrowser-launcher\nfrom your distribution's package manager and it handles everything else:\n\n* Downloads and installs the most recent version of Tor Browser in your language\n  and for your computer's architecture, or launches Tor Browser if it's already\n  installed (Tor Browser will automatically update itself)\n* Verifies Tor Browser's signature for you, to ensure the version you downloaded\n  was cryptographically signed by Tor developers and was not tampered with\n* Adds \"Tor Browser\" and \"Tor Browser Launcher Settings\" application launcher\n  to your desktop environment's menu\n* Optionally plays a modem sound when you open Tor Browser\n  (because Tor is so slow)\n",
