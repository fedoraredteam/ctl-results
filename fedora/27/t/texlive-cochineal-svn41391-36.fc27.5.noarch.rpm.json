            "Description": "\nCochineal is a fork from the Crimson fonts (Roman, Italic,\nBold, BoldItalic only) released under the OFL by Sebastian\nKosch. These remarkable fonts are inspired by the famous\noldstyle fonts in the garalde family (Garamond, Bembo) but, in\nthe end, look more similar to Minion, though with smaller\nxheight and less plain in detail. The Crimson fonts on which\nthese were based had roughly 4200 glyphs in the four styles\nmentioned above. Cochineal adds more than 1500 glyphs in those\nstyles so that it is possible to make a TeX support collection\nthat contains essentially all glyphs in all styles. Bringing\nthe Semibold styles up the same level would have required\nadding about 2000 additional glyphs, which I could not even\ncontemplate. The fonts are provided in OpenType and PostScript\nformats.\n",
