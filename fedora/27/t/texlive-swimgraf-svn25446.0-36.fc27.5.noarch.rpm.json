            "Description": "\nThe package provides two macros that produce representations of\na swimmer's performances. The user records data in a text file\nand specifies as arguments of the macros the date range of\ninterest. The macros extract the relevant information from the\nfile and process it: \\swimgraph produces a graph of the times\nin a single swimming event (specified as an argument), plotting\nlong course and short course times in separate lines. Records\nand qualifying times, stored in text files, may optionally be\nincluded on the graph. \\swimtext produces a written record of\nthe times in all events. Files of current world and Canadian\nrecords are included. The package requires the PSTricks and\nkeyval packages. For attractive output it also requires a\ncolour output device.\n",
