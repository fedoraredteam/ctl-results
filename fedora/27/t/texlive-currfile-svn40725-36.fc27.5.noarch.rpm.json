In particular, it\nrestores the parent file name after the trailing \\clearpage of\nan \\included file; as a result, the macros may be usefully\nemployed in the page header and footer of the last printed page\nof such a file. The depth of inclusion is made available,\ntogether with the \"parent\" (including file) and \"parents\" (all\nincluding files to the root of the tree). The package\nsupersedes FiNK.\n",
