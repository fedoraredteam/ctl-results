            "Description": "\nTeX macros for converting Adobe Font Metric files to TeX metric\nand virtual font format. Fontinst helps mainly with the number\ncrunching and shovelling parts of font installation. This means\nin practice that it creates a number of files which give the\nTeX metrics (and related information) for a font family that\n(La)TeX needs to do any typesetting in these fonts. Fontinst\nfurthermore makes it easy to create fonts containing glyphs\nfrom more than one base font, taking advantage of (e.g.)\n\"expert\" font sets. Fontinst cannot examine files to see if\nthey contain any useful information, nor automatically search\nfor files or work with binary file formats; those tasks must\nnormally be done manually or with the help of some other tool,\nsuch as the pltotf and vptovf programs.\n",
