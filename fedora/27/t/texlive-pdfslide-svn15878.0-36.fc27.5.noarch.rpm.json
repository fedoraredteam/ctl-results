Its aims are: to devise a method for\neasier technical presentation; to help the mix of mathematical\nformulae with text and graphics which other present day\ndocument processing tools fail to accomplish; to exploit the\nplatform independence of TeX so that presentation documents\nbecome portable; and to offer the freedom and possibilities of\nusing various backgrounds and other embellishments that a user\ncan imagine to have in as presentation. The package can make\nuse of the facilities of the PPower4 post-processor.\n",
