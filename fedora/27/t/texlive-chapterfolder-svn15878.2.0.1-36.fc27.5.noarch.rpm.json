It provides\nmacros to define a folder that contains the file for a\nchapter/section/subsection, and provides macros that allow\ninclusion without using the full path, rather the path relative\nto the current folder of the chapter/section/subsection. It\nmakes easy changing the name of a folder, for example.\n",
