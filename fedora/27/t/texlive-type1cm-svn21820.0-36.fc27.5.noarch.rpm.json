            "Description": "\nLaTeX, by default, restricts the sizes at which you can use its\ndefault computer modern fonts, to a fixed set of discrete sizes\n(effectively, a set specified by Knuth). The type1cm package\nremoves this restriction; this is particularly useful when\nusing scalable versions of the cm fonts (Bakoma, or the\nversions from BSR/Y&Y, or True Type versions from Kinch, PCTeX,\netc.). In fact, since modern distributions will automatically\ngenerate any bitmap font you might need, type1cm has wider\napplication than just those using scaleable versions of the\nfonts. Note that the LaTeX distribution now contains a package\nfix-cm, which performs the task of type1cm, as well as doing\nthe same job for T1- and TS1-encoded ec fonts.\n",
