            "Description": "\nThe PSTricks macros cannot be used (directly) with pdfTeX,\nsince pstricks uses PostScript arithmetic, which isn't part of\nPDF. This package circumvents this limitation so that the\nextensive facilities offered by the powerful PSTricks package\ncan be made use of in a pdfTeX document. This is done using the\nshell escape function available in current TeX implementations.\nThe package may also be used in support of other 'PostScript-\noutput-only' packages, such as PSfrag. For alternatives, users\nmay care to review the discussion in the PSTricks online\ndocumentation.\n",
