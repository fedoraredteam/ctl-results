            "Description": "\nThe package provides facilities for creating and managing keys\nin the sense of the keyval and xkeyval packages, but it is\nintended to be more robust and faster. Its robustness comes\nfrom its ability to preserve braces in key values throughout\nparsing. The need to preserve braces in key values arises often\nin parsing keys (for example, in the xwatermark package). The\npackage is faster than xkeyval package because (among other\nthings) it avoids character-wise parsing of key values (called\n\"selective sanitization\" by the xkeyval package). The package\nalso provides functions for defining and managing keys.\n",
