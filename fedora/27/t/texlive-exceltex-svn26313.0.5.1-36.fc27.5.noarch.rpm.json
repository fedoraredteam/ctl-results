            "Description": "\nExceltex is a LaTeX package combined with a helper program\nwritten in Perl. It provides an easy to use yet powerfull and\nflexible way to get data from Spreadsheets into LaTeX. In\ncontrast to other solutions, exceltex does not seek to make the\ncreation of tables in LaTeX easier, but to get data from\nSpreadsheets into LaTeX as easily as possible. The Excel (TM)\nfile format only acts as an interface between the spreadsheet\napplication and exceltex beacause it is easily accessible (via\nthe Spreadsheet::ParseExcel Perl module) and because most\nspreadsheet applications are able to read and write Excel\nfiles.\n",
