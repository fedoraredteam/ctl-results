            "Description": "\nThis package aims to improve of font readability in\npresentations, especially with maths. The standard cm maths\nfonts at large design sizes are difficult to read from far\naway, especially at low resolutions and low contrast color\nchoice. Using this package leads to much better overall\nreadability of some font combinations. The package offers a\ncouple of 'harmonising' combinations of text and maths fonts\nfrom the (distant) relatives of computer modern fonts, with a\ncouple of extras for optimising readability. Text fonts from\ncomputer modern roman, computer modern sans serif, SliTeX\ncomputer modern sans serif, computer modern bright, or concrete\nroman are available, in addition to maths fonts from computer\nmodern maths, computer modern bright maths, or Euler fonts. The\npackage is part of the TeXPower bundle.\n",
