It is based on sslscan, a\nthorough SSL/TLS scanner that is based on the openssl library, and on the\n\"openssl s_client\" command line tool. The current tests include checking if\nthe target supports the SSLv2 protocol, the NULL cipher, weak ciphers based\non their key length (40 or 56 bits), the availability of strong ciphers\n(like AES), if the digital certificate is MD5 signed, and the current SSL/TLS\nrenegotiation capabilities.\n",
