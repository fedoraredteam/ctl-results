It also provides a\nmacro \\inferrule for typeseting fractions where both the\nnumerator and denominator may be sequences of formulas that\nwill be also typeset in a similar way. It can typically be used\nfor typeseting sets of type inference rules or typing\nderivations. A macro inferrule for typesetting type inference\nrules.\n",
