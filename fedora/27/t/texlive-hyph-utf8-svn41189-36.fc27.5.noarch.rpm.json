            "Description": "\nModern native UTF-8 engines such as XeTeX and LuaTeX need\nhyphenation patterns in UTF-8 format, whereas older systems\nrequire hyphenation patterns in the 8-bit encoding of the font\nin use (such encodings are codified in the LaTeX scheme with\nnames like OT1, T2A, TS1, OML, LY1, etc). The present package\noffers a collection of conversions of existing patterns to UTF-\n8 format, together with converters for use with 8-bit fonts in\nolder systems. Since hyphenation patterns for Knuthian-style\nTeX systems are only read at iniTeX time, it is hoped that the\nUTF-8 patterns, with their converters, will completely supplant\nthe older patterns.\n",
