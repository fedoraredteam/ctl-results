            "Description": "\nThe package contains the Antykwa Poltawskiego family of fonts\nin the PostScript Type 1 and OpenType formats. The original\nfont was designed in the twenties of the XX century by the\nPolish typographer Adam Poltawski(1881-1952). Following the\nroute set out by the Latin Modern and TeX Gyre projects\n(http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry), the Antykwa\nPoltawskiego digitisation project aims at providing a rich\ncollection of diacritical characters in the attempt to cover as\nmany Latin-based scripts as possible. To our knowledge, the\nrepertoire of characters covers all European languages as well\nas some other Latin-based alphabets such as Vietnamese and\nNavajo; at the request of users, recent extensions (following\nthe enhancement of the Latin Modern collection) provide glyphs\nsufficient for typesetting of romanized transliterations of\nArabic and Sanskrit scripts. The Antykwa Poltawskiego family\nconsists of 4 weights (light, normal, medium, bold), each\nhaving upright and italic forms and one of 5 design sizes: 6,\n8, 10, 12 and 17pt. Altogether, the collection comprises 40\nfont files, containing the same repertoire of 1126 characters.\nThe preliminary version of Antykwa Poltawskiego (antp package)\nreleased in 2000 is rendered obsolete by this package.\n",
