The font supports\ntypesetting of Old and Middle English, Old Icelandic, Cyrillic\n(with historical characters, extensions for Old Slavonic and\nlocalised forms), Gothic transliterations, critical editions of\nClassical Greek and Latin, and many more. Old Standard works\nwith TeX engines that directly support OpenType features, such\nas XeTeX and LuaTeX.\n",
