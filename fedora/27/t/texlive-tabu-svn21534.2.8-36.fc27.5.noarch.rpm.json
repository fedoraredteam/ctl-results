            "Description": "\nThe package provides an environment, tabu, which will make any\nsort of tabular (that doesn't need to split across pages), and\nan environment longtabu which provides the facilities of tabu\nin a modified longtable environment. (Note that this latter\noffers an enhancement of ltxtable.) The package requires the\narray package, and needs e-TeX to run (since array.sty is\npresent in every conforming distribution of LaTeX, and since\nevery publicly available LaTeX format is built using e-TeX, the\nrequirements are provided by default on any reasonable system).\nThe package also requires xcolor for coloured rules in tables,\nand colortbl for coloured cells. The longtabu environment\nfurther requires that longtable be loaded. The package itself\ndoes not load any of these packages for the user. The tabu\nenvironment may be used in place of tabular, tabular* and\ntabularx environments, as well as the array environment in\nmaths mode. It overloads tabularx's X-column specification,\nallowing a width specification, alignment (l, r, c and j) and\ncolumn type indication (p, m and b). \\begin{tabu} to <dimen>\nspecifies a target width, and \\begin{tabu} spread <dimen>\nenlarges the environment's \"natural\" width.\n",
