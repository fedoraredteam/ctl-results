            "Description": "\nMonTeX provides Mongolian and Manju support for the TeX/LaTeX\ncommunity. Mongolian is a language spoken in North East Asia,\nnamely Mongolia and the Inner Mongol Autonomous Region of\nChina. Today, it is written in an extended Cyrillic alphabet in\nMongolia whereas the Uighur writing continues to be in use in\nInner Mongolia, though it is also, legally speaking, the\nofficial writing system of Mongolia. Manju is another language\nof North East Asia, belonging to the Tungusic branch of the\nAltaic languages. Though it is hardly spoken nowadays, it\nsurvives in written form as Manju was the native language of\nthe rulers of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) in China. Large\nquantities of documents of the Imperial Archives survive, as\nwell as some of the finest dictionaries ever compiled in Asia,\nlike the Pentaglot, a dictionary comprising Manju, Tibetan,\nMongolian, Uighur and Chinese. MonTeX provides all necessary\ncharacters for writing standard Mongolian in Cyrillic and\nClassical (aka Traditional or Uighur) writing, and Manju as\nwell as transliterated Tibetan texts, for which purpose a\nnumber of additional characters was created. In MonTeX, both\nMongolian and Manju are entered in romanized form. The\nretransliteration (from Latin input to Mongolian and Manju\noutput) is completely realized in TeX/Metafont so that no\nexternal preprocessor is required. Please note that most of the\nenhanced functions of MonTeX require a working e-LaTeX\nenvironment. This is especially true when compiling documents\nwith Mongolian or Manju as the main document language. It is\nrecommended to choose pdfelatex as the resulting PDF files are\ntruly portable. Vertical text generated by MonTeX is not\nsupported in DVI.\n",
