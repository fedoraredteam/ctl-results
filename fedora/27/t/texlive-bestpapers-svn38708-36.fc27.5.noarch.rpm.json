            "Description": "\nMany people preparing their resumes find the requirement\n\"please list five (or six, or ten) papers authored by you\". The\nsame requirement is often stated for reports prepared by\nprofessional teams. The creation of such lists may be a\ncumbersome task. Even more difficult is it to support such\nlists over the time, when new papers are added. The BibTeX\nstyle bestpapers.bst is intended to facilitate this task. It is\nbased on the idea that it is easier to score than to sort: We\ncan assign a score to a paper and then let the computer select\nthe papers with highest scores. This work was commissioned by\nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, United States\nTreasury. This package is in the public domain.\n",
