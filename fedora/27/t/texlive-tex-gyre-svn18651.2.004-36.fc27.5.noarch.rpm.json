            "Description": "\nThe TeX-GYRE bundle consists of six font families: TeX Gyre\nAdventor is based on the URW Gothic L family of fonts (which is\nderived from ITC Avant Garde Gothic, designed by Herb Lubalin\nand Tom Carnase). TeX Gyre Bonum is based on the URW Bookman L\nfamily (from Bookman Old Style, designed by Alexander\nPhemister). TeX Gyre Chorus is based on URW Chancery L Medium\nItalic (from ITC Zapf Chancery, designed by Hermann Zapf in\n1979). TeX-Gyre Cursor is based on URW Nimbus Mono L (based on\nCourier, designed by Howard G. Kettler in 1955, for IBM). TeX\nGyre Heros is based on URW Nimbus Sans L (from Helvetica,\nprepared by Max Miedinger, with Eduard Hoffmann in 1957). TeX\nGyre Pagella is based on URW Palladio L (from Palatino,\ndesigned by Hermann Zapf in the 1940s). TeX Gyre Schola is\nbased on the URW Century Schoolbook L family (which was\ndesigned by Morris Fuller Benton for the American Type\nFounders). TeX Gyre Termes is based on the URW Nimbus Roman No9\nL family of fonts (whose original, Times, was designed by\nStanley Morison together with Starling Burgess and Victor\nLardent and first offered by Monotype). The constituent\nstandard faces of each family have been greatly extended, and\ncontain nearly 1100 glyphs each (though Chorus omits Greek\nsupport, has no small-caps family and has approximately 800\nglyphs). Each family is available in Adobe Type 1 and Open Type\nformats, and LaTeX support (for use with a variety of\nencodings) is provided. Vietnamese characters were added by Han\nThe Thanh.\n",
