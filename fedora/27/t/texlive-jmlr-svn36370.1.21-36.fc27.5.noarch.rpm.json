The class uses the\ncombine class and the hyperref package to produce either a\ncolour hyperlinked book for on-line viewing or a greyscale\nnonhyperlinked book for printing. The makejmlrbook Perl script\ncan be used to create the colour hyperlinked and greyscale\nnonhyperlinked PDFs of a document using the jmlrbook class. It\ncan also create a set of HTML files that list the included\npapers with links to their abstracts and the individual\narticles as PDFs.\n",
