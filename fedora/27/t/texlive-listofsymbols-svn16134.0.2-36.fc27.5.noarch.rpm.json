            "Description": "\nListofsymbols provides commands to automatically create a list\nof symbols (also called notation or nomenclature), and to\nhandle symbols logically, i.e. define a macro that is expanded\nto the desired output and use the macro in the text rather than\n`hardcoding' the output into the text. This helps to ensure\nconsistency throughout the text, especially if there is a\nchance that symbols will be changed at some stage. The package\nis more or less a combination of what the packages nomencl and\nformula do. The concept of creating the list of symbols,\nthough, is different from the way nomencl.sty does it.\n",
