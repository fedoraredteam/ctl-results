            "Description": "\nXdoc is a project to rewrite the implementation of the LaTeX\ndoc package (in a broader sense) to make its features more\ngeneral and flexible. For example, where doc only provides\ncommands for documenting macros and environments, xdoc also\nprovides commands for similarly documenting package options and\nswitches. This is furthermore done in such a way that it is\nvery easy to add more such commands for documenting things,\nsuch as e.g., templates (an important concept in the future\nLaTeX3) and program components for other languages (functions,\nclasses, procedures, etc.). A side effect is that many minor\nbugs in doc are fixed. The design aims to take advantage of\nmany still experimental features of future versions of LaTeX,\nbut since these are neither reasonably stable nor widely\navailable, the configuration interfaces and package author\ncommands of xdoc are likely to change. To still provide a\nstable interface for other packages to build upon, the actual\npackage names include a \"major version number\" of sorts. The\ndrop-in replacement package for standard doc is xdoc2; it\nrequires nothing outside standard LaTeX2e. The\ndocindex/docidx2e package changes the index and list of changes\ntypesetting so that none of the formatting has to be controlled\nvia the index style file. The docindex package provides control\nof formatting via templates (nice interface, but requires\nseveral experimental packages), whereas the docidx2e package\nhas traditional raw macro interfaces and works with standard\nLaTeX2e.\n",
