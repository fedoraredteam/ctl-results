            "Description": "\nThe fontch macros allow the user to change font size and family\nanywhere in a plain TeX document. Sizes of 8, 10, 12, 14, 20\nand 24 points are available. A sans serif family (\\sf) is\ndefined in addition to the families already defined in plain\nTeX. Optional support for Latin Modern T1 and TS1 fonts is\ngiven. There are macros for non-latin1 letters and for most TS1\nsymbols. Math mode always uses CM fonts. A command for\nproducing doubled-spaced documents is also provided. The\npresent version of the package is designed to deal with the\nlatest release of the Latin Modern fonts version 1.106.\nUnfortunately, it can no longer support earlier versions of the\nfonts, so an obsolete version of the package is retained for\nusers who don't yet have access to the latest version of the\nfonts.\n",
