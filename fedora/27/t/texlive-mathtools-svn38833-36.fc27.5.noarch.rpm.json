            "Description": "\nMathtools provides a series of packages designed to enhance the\nappearance of documents containing a lot of mathematics. The\nmain backbone is amsmath, so those unfamiliar with this\nrequired part of the LaTeX system will probably not find the\npackages very useful. Mathtools provides many useful tools for\nmathematical typesetting. It is based on amsmath and fixes\nvarious deficiencies of amsmath and standard LaTeX. It\nprovides: Extensible symbols, such as brackets, arrows,\nharpoons, etc.; Various symbols such as \\coloneqq (:=); Easy\ncreation of new tag forms; Showing equation numbers only for\nreferenced equations; Extensible arrows, harpoons and\nhookarrows; Starred versions of the amsmath matrix environments\nfor specifying the column alignment; More building blocks:\nmultlined, cases-like environments, new gathered environments;\nMaths versions of \\makebox, \\llap, \\rlap etc.; Cramped math\nstyles; and more... Mathtools requires mhsetup.\n",
