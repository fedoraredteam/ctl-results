The\nalphabet is essentially syllabic, only 6 characters (a e i o s\nu) correspond to Roman letters: the font encodes these to the\ncorresponding roman letter. The remaining 79 characters have\nbeen arbitrarily encoded in the range 38-122; the cherokee\npackage provides commands that map each such syllable to the\nappropriate character; for example, Segwoya himself would be\nrepresented \\Cse\\Cgwo\\Cya. The font is distributed as Metafont\nsource; it works very poorly in modern environments, and could\ndo with expert attention (if you are interested, please contact\nthe CTAN team for details).\n",
