            "Description": "\nThis package provides for LuaLaTeX an ArabTeX-like interface to\ngenerate Arabic writing from an ascii transliteration. It is\nparticularly well-suited for complex documents such as\ntechnical documents or critical editions where a lot of left-to-\nright commands intertwine with Arabic writing. arabluatex is\nable to process any ArabTeX input notation. Its output can be\nset in the same modes of vocalization as ArabTeX, or in\ndifferent roman transliterations. It further allows many\ntypographical refinements. It will eventually interact with\nsome other packages yet to come to produce from .tex source\nfiles, in addition to printed books, TEI xml compliant critical\neditions and/or lexicons that can be searched, analyzed and\ncorrelated in various ways.\n",
