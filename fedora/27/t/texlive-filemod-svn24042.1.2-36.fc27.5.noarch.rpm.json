The files may be .tex files,\nimages or other files (as long as they can be found by LaTeX).\nIt uses the \\pdffilemoddate primitive of pdfLaTeX to find the\nfile modification date as PDF date string, parses the string\nand returns the value to the user. The package will also work\nfor DVI output with recent versions of the LaTeX compiler which\nuses pdfLaTeX in DVI mode. The functionality is provided by\npurely expandable macros or by faster but non-expandable ones.\n",
