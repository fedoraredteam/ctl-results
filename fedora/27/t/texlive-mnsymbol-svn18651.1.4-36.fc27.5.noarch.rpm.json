The fonts are available both as Metafont\nsource and as Adobe Type 1 format, and a comprehensive support\npackage is provided. While the fonts were designed to fit with\nMinon Pro, the design should fit well with other renaissance or\nbaroque faces: indeed, it will probably work with most fonts\nthat are neither too wide nor too thin, for example Palatino or\nTimes; it is known to look good with Sabon. There is no package\ndesigned to configure its use with any font other than Minion\nPro, but (for example) simply loading mnsymbol after mathpazo\nwill probably do what is needed.\n",
