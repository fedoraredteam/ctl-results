            "Description": "\nProvides a class exam, which eases production of exams, even by\na LaTeX novice. Simple commands are provided to: create\nquestions, parts of questions, subparts of parts, and\nsubsubparts of subparts, all with optional point values; create\na grading table, indexed either by question number (listing\neach question and the total possible points for that question)\nor by page number (listing each page with points and the total\npossible points for that page); create headers and footers that\nare each specified in three parts: one part to be left\njustified, one part to be centered, and one part to be right\njustified, in the manner of fancyhdr Headers and/or footers can\nbe different on the first page of the exam, can be different on\nthe last page of the exam, and can vary depending on whether\nthe page number is odd or even, or on whether the current page\ncontinues a question from a previous page, or on whether the\nlast question on the current page continues onto the following\npage. Multiple line headers and/or footers are allowed, and\nit's easy to increase the part of the page devoted to headers\nand/or footers to allow for this. Note that the bundle exams\nalso provides a file exam.cls; the two bundles therefore clash,\nand should not be installed on the same system.\n",
