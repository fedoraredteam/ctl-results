The\nfamily currently includes upright, italic and small-caps shapes\nin each of regular and demi-bold weights and an italic script\nin regular. The support package renames the fonts according to\nthe Karl Berry fontname scheme and defines four families. Two\nof these primarily provide access to the \"standard\" or default\ncharacters while the \"alternate\" families support alternate\ncharacters, additional ligatures and the long s. The included\npackage files provide access to these features in LaTeX as\nexplained in the documentation. The LaTeX support requires the\nnfssext-cfr and the xkeyval packages.\n",
