Unfortunately, most of the\ndocumentation is only available in German. Since the document\nclass is intended to generate a unique layout, many things\n(layout etc.) are fixed and cannot be altered by the user. If\nyou want to use the document class for another purpose than\npublishing with the Teubner Verlag, this may arrise unwanted\nrestrictions (For instance, the document class provides only\ntwo paper sizes: DIN A-5 and 17cm x 24cm; only two font\nfamilies are supported: Times and European Computer Modern).\n",
