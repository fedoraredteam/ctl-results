            "Description": "\nThe accfonts package contains three utilities to permit easy\nmanipulation of fonts, in particular the creation of unusual\naccented characters. Mkt1font works on Adobe Type 1 fonts,\nvpl2vpl works on TeX virtual fonts and vpl2ovp transforms a TeX\nfont to an Omega one. All three programs read in a font (either\nthe font itself or a property list), together with a simple\ndefinition file containing lines such as '128 z acute'; they\nthen write out a new version of the font with the requested new\ncharacters in the numerical slots specified. Great care is\ntaken over the positioning of accents, and over the provision\nof kerning information for new characters; mkt1font also\ngenerates suitable \"hints\" to enhance quality at small sizes or\npoor resolutions. The programs are written in Perl.\n",
