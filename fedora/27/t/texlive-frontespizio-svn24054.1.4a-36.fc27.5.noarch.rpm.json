This package provides a solution by\nproducing an auxiliary TeX file to be typeset on its own and\nthe result is automatically included at the next run. The\nmarkup necessary for the frontispiece is written in the main\ndocument in a frontespizio environment. Documentation is mainly\nin Italian, as the style is probably apt only to theses in\nItaly.\n",
