It is\nhighly configurable, and its modular structure provides you\nwith building blocks of increasing level, by means of which you\ncan compose a large variety of letters. It is also possible to\nwrite letters divided into sections and paragraphs, to include\nfloating figures and tables, and to have the relevant indexes\ncompiled automatically. A single input file can contain several\nletters, and each letter will have its own table of contents,\netc., independant from the other ones.\n",
