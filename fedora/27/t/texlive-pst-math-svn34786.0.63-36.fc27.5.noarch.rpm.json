            "Description": "\nPostScript lacks a lot of basic operators such as tan, acos,\nasin, cosh, sinh, tanh, acosh, asinh, atanh, exp (with e base).\nAlso (oddly) cos and sin use arguments in degrees. Pst-math\nprovides all those operators in a header file pst-math.pro with\nwrappers pst-math.sty and pst-math.tex. In addition, sinc,\ngauss, gammaln and bessel are implemented (only partially for\nthe latter). The package is designed essentially to work with\npst-plot but can be used in whatever PS code (such as pstricks\nSpecialCoor \"!\", which is useful for placing labels). The\npackage also provides a routine SIMPSON for numerical\nintegration and a solver of linear equation systems.\n",
