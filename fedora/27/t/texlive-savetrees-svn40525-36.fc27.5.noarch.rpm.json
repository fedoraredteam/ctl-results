Nevertheless, savetrees\nis a simple way to save paper when printing draft copies of a\ndocument. It can also be useful when trying to meet a tight\npage-length requirement for a conference or journal submission.\nMost of the package options cover specific modifications to\ntypesetting rules, but there are also options subtle, moderate\nand extreme options for the \"broad brush\" approach.\n",
