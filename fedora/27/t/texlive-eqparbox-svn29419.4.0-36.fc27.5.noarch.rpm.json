            "Description": "\nLaTeX users sometimes need to ensure that two or more blocks of\ntext occupy the same amount of horizontal space on the page. To\nthat end, the eqparbox package defines a new command,\n\\eqparbox, which works just like \\parbox, except that instead\nof specifying a width, one specifies a tag. All eqparboxes with\nthe same tag--regardless of where they are in the document--\nwill stretch to fit the widest eqparbox with that tag. This\nsimple, equal-width mechanism can be used for a variety of\nalignment purposes, as is evidenced by the examples in\neqparbox's documentation. Various derivatives of \\eqparbox are\nalso provided.\n",
