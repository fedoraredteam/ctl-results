An\nalgorithm becomes a floating object (like figure, table, etc.).\nThe package provides macros that allow you to create different\nkeywords, and a set of predefined key words is provided; you\ncan change the typography of the keywords. The package allows\nvertical lines delimiting a block of instructions in an\nalgorithm, and defines different sorts of algorithms such as\nProcedure or Function; the name of these functions may be\nreused in the text or in other algorithms.\n",
