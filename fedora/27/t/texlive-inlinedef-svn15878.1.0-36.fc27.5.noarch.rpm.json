            "Description": "\nThe package provides a macro \\Inline that precedes a \\def or\n\\gdef. Within the definition text of an inlined definition,\nkeywords such as \\Expand may be used to selectively inline\ncertain expansions at definition-time. This eases the process\nof redefining macros in terms of the original definition, as\nwell as definitions in which the token that must be expanded is\ndeep within, where \\expandafter would be difficult and \\edef is\nnot suitable. Another application is as an easier version of\n\\aftergroup, by defining a macro in terms of expanded local\nvariables, then ending the group with\n\\expandafter\\endgroup\\macro.\n",
