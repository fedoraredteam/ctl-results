            "Description": "\nThe package provides a large and sundry set of macros for the\nmanipulation of strings. The macros are developed not merely\nfor cosmetic application (such as changing the case of letters\nand string substitution), but also for programming applications\nsuch as character look-ahead, argument parsing, conditional\ntests on various string conditions, etc. The macros were\ndesigned all to be expandable (note that things such as\n\\uppercase and \\lowercase are not expandable), so that the\nmacros may be strung together sequentially and nested (after a\nfashion) to achieve rather complex manipulations.\n",
