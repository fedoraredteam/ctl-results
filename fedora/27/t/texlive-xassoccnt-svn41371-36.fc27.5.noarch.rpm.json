This package can\nbe regarded as a supplement to the totcount package by\nVasileios Koutavas, but it can be used without it, too.\nxassoccnt is a successor and a complete rewrite of the assoccnt\npackage by the same author. However, as of 2015/11/07, some\nfeatures of assoccnt are not (yet) contained in xassoccnt, so\nthat the older package cannot yet be regarded as obsolete.\n",
