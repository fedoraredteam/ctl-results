            "Description": "\n'ionumbers' stands for 'input/output numbers'. The package\nrestyles numbers in maths mode. If a number in the input file\nis written, e.g., as $3,231.44$ as commonly used in English\ntexts, the package is able to restyle it to be output as\n$3\\,231{,}44$ as commonly used in German texts (and vice\nversa). This may be useful, for example, if you have a large\ntable and want to include it in texts with different output\nconventions without the need to change the table. The package\ncan also automatically group digits left of the decimal\nseparator (thousands) and right of the decimal separator\n(thousandths) in triplets without the need of specifing commas\n(English) or points (German) as separators. E.g., the input\n$1234.567890$ can be output as $1\\,234.\\,567\\,890$. Finally, an\ne starts the exponent of the number. For example, $21e6$ may be\noutput as $26\\times10\\,^{6}$.\n",
