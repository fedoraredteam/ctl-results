            "Description": "\nThe Cyclop typeface was designed in the 1920s at the workshop\nof Warsaw type foundry \"Odlewnia Czcionek J. Idzkowski i S-ka\".\nThis sans serif typeface has a highly modulated stroke so it\nhas high typographic contrast. The vertical stems are much\nheavier then horizontal ones. Most characters have thin\nrectangles as additional counters giving the unique shape of\nthe characters. The lead types of Cyclop typeface were produced\nin slanted variant at sizes 8-48 pt. It was heavily used for\nheads in newspapers and accidents prints. Typesetters used\nCyclop in the inter-war period, during the occupation in the\nunderground press. The typeface was used until the beginnings\nof the offset print and computer typesetting era. Nowadays it\nis hard to find the metal types of this typeface. The font was\ngenerated using the Metatype1 package. Then the original set of\ncharacters was completed by adding the full set of accented\nletters and characters of the modern Latin alphabets (including\nVietnamese). The upright variant was generated and it was more\ncomplicated task than it appeared at the beginning. 11 upright\nletters of the Cyclop typeface were presented in the book by\nFilip Trzaska, \"Podstawy techniki wydawniczej\" (\"Foundation of\nthe publishing techonology\"), Warsaw 1967. But even the author\nof the book does not know what was the source of the presented\nexamples. The fonts are distributed in the Type1 and OpenType\nformats along with the files necessary for use these fonts in\nTeX and LaTeX including encoding definition files: T1 (ec), T5\n(Vietnamese), OT4, QX, texnansi and nonstandard ones (IL2 for\nCzech fonts).\n",
