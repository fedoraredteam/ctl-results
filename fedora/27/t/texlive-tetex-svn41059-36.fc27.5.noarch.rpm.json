In 2006, Thomas Esser announced he would no\nlonger be able to support, or to produce new versions of,\nteTeX. With the appearance of TeX live 2007 (whose Unix-system\nTeX support originally derived from teTeX), no-one should be\nusing teTeX at all, in new applications. One of the \"schemes\"\navailable when installing TeX live provides a configuration\nvery close to that of the old teTeX, but using modern versions\nof programs and packages.\n",
