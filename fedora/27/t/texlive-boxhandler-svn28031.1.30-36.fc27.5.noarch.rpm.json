            "Description": "\nThe package allows the user to optimise presentation of LaTeX\ntables and figures. Boxhandler will lay out table and figure\ncaptions with a variety of stylistic apperances, and will also\nallow figures and tables to be \"wrapped\" in a manner consistent\nwith many business and government documents. For a document\nthat might appear in different venues with different\nformatting, boxhandler permits the creation of a LaTeX source\ndocument that can, with a single-line change in the source\ncode, produce an output that has very different layout from the\nbaseline configuration, not only in terms of caption style, but\nmore importantly in terms of the locations where figures,\ntables and lists appear (or not) in the document. Deferral\nroutines also allow one to keep all figure and table data in a\nseparate source file, while nonetheless producing a document\nwith figures and tables appearing in the desired location.\n",
