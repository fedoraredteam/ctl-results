The\npackages are based on pennames.sty by Michel Goosens and Eric\nvan Herwijnen. Heppennames re-implements the particle names in\npennames.sty, with some additions and alterations and greater\nflexibility and robustness due to the hepparticles structures,\nwhich were written for this purpose. Hepnicenames provides the\nmain non-resonant particle names from heppennames with more\n\"friendly\" names.\n",
