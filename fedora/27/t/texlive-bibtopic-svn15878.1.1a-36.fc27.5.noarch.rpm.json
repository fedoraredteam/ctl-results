The package provides commands to\ninclude either all references from a .bib file, only the\nreferences actually cited or those not cited in your document.\nThe user has to construct a separate .bib file for each\nbibliographic 'topic', each of which will be processed\nseparately by BibTeX. If you want to have bibliographies\nspecific to one part of a document, see the packages bibunits\nor chapterbib.\n",
