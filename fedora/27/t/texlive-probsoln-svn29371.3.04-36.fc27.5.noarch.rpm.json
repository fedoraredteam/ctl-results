            "Description": "\nThe package is designed for lecturers who have to generate new\nproblem sheets for their students on a regular basis (e.g.\nyearly) by randomly selecting a specified number of problems\ndefined in another file. The package allows you easily to\ngenerate a new problem sheet that is different from the\nprevious year, thus alleviating the temptation of students to\nseek out the previous year's students and checking out their\nanswers. The solutions to the problems can be defined along\nwith the problem, making it easy to generate the solution sheet\nfrom the same source code; problems may be reused within a\ndocument, so that solutions may appear in a different section\nof the same document as the problems they cover.\n",
