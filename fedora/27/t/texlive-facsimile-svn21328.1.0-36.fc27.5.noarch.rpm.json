The class covers two\nareas: First, a title page is created with a detailed fax\nheader; second, every page gets headers and footers so that the\nrecipient can be sure that every page has been received and all\npages are complete, and in the correct order. The class evolved\nfrom the fax package, and provides much better language\nsupport.\n",
