            "Description": "\nThe package provides support for the manipulation and reference\nof small or 'sub' figures and tables within a single figure or\ntable environment. It is convenient to use this package when\nyour subfigures are to be separately captioned, referenced, or\nare to be included in the List-of-Figures. A new \\subfigure\ncommand is introduced which can be used inside a figure\nenvironment for each subfigure. An optional first argument is\nused as the caption for that subfigure. This package supersedes\nthe subfigure package (which is no longer maintained). The name\nwas changed since the package is completely backward compatible\nwith the older package The major advantage to the new package\nis that the user interface is keyword/value driven and easier\nto use. To ease the transition from the subfigure package, the\ndistribution it includes a configuration file (subfig.cfg)\nwhich nearly emulates the subfigure package. The functionality\nof the package is provided by the (more recent still)\nsubcaption package.\n",
