It is therefore an ideal application for\na text-based document preparation system such as LaTeX, in\nconcert with a distributed version control system such as SVN.\nThe proposal class itself provides a basis for such an\nenterprise. The dfgproposal and dfgproposal classes provide two\nspecialisations of the base class for (respectively) German and\nEuropean research proposals. The packages depend on the\nauthor's stex bundle.\n",
