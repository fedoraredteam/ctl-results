            "Description": "\nMathsPIC(Perl) is a development of the earlier MathsPIC(DOS)\nprogram, now implemented as a Perl script, being much more\nportable than the earlier program. MathsPIC parses a plain text\ninput file and generates a plain text output-file containing\ncommands for drawing a diagram. Version 1.0 produces output\ncontaining PiCTeX and (La)TeX commands, which may then be\nprocessed by plain TeX or LaTeX in the usual way. MathsPIC also\noutputs a comprehensive log-file. MathsPIC facilitates creating\nfigures using PiCTeX by providing an environment for\nmanipulating named points and also allows the use of variables\nand maths (advance, multiply, and divide)--in short--it takes\nthe pain out of PiCTeX. Both the original DOS version and the\nnew Perl version are available.\n",
