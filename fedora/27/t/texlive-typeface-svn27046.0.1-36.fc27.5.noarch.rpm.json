It allows mixing and\nmatching the Type 1 font sets available on the archive (and it\nmay be extended, via its configuration file, to support other\nfonts). Font-set definition takes the form of a set of options\nthat are read when the package is loaded: for each typographic\ncategory (main body font, sans-serif font, monospace font,\nmathematics fonts, text figures, and so on), a font or a\ntransformation is given in those options. The approach enables\nthe user to remember their own configurations (as a single\ncommand) and to borrow configurations that other users have\ndeveloped. The present release is designated \"for review\".\n",
