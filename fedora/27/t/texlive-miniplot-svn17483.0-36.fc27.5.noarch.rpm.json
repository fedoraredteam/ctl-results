Figures can be arranged\nas one-figure-only or as a collection of figures in columns and\nrows which can itself contain sub-figures in columns and rows.\nWrapped figures are also supported. This package provides\ncommands to display a framebox instead of the figure as the\ngraphics package does already but additionally it writes useful\ninformation such as the label and scaling factor into these\nboxes.\n",
