            "Description": "\nThe package extends the LaTeX labelling system: whenever a\nlabel is set, the values of counters (selected by the user) are\nrecorded, along with the label. The value of these counters can\nbe recalled with a command similar to \\pageref. The package\nalso adds commands \\s[name]ref (for each counter [name] that\nthe user has selected); these commands display something only\nif the value of the [name] counter is changed from when the\nlabel was set. Many commands are provided to serve as a macro\nprogramming environment for using the extended labels.\n",
