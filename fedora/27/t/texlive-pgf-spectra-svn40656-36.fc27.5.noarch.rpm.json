            "Description": "\nThe purpose of this package is to draw the spectra of elements\nin a simple way. It is based on the package pst-spectra,\nsupporting the same options, but also adding some new options.\nIt relies on PGF/TikZ for drawing the desired spectrum,\ncontinuous or discrete. As in pst-spectra, there are data\navailable for the spectra of 99 elements and their ions (from\nthe NASA database). It also allows the user to draw spectra\nusing their own data.\n",
