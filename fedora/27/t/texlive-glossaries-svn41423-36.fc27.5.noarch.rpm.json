New entries are defined to have a name and\ndescription (and optionally an associated symbol). Support for\nmultiple languages is offered, and plural forms of terms may be\nspecified. An additional package, glossaries-accsupp, can make\nuse of the accsupp package mechanisms for accessibility support\nfor PDF files containing glossaries. The user may define new\nglossary styles, and preambles and postambles can be specified.\nThere is provision for loading a database of terms, but only\nterms used in the text will be added to the relevant glossary.\nThe package uses an indexing program to provide the actual\nglossary; either makeindex or xindy may serve this purpose, and\na Perl script is provided to serve as interface. The package\ndistribution also provides the mfirstuc package, for changing\nthe first letter of a word to upper case. The package\nsupersedes the author's glossary package (which is now\nobsolete), and a conversion tool is provided.\n",
