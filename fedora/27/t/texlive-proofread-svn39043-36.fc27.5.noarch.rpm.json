These allow you to\neasily highlight text and add comments in the margin. Vim\nescape sequences are provided for inserting these LaTeX\ncommands in the source. The package is based on code for a text\nhighlighting command that was published by Antal S-Z in\nhref='http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/5959'. The main\nfile, proofread.dtx, is self-extracting, so you can generate\nthe style file by compiling proofread.dtx with pdfLaTeX.\n",
