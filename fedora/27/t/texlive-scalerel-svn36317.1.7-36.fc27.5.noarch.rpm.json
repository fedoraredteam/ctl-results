            "Description": "\nThe package provides four commands for vertically scaling and\nstretching objects. Its primary function is the ability to\nscale/stretch and shift one object to conform to the size of a\nspecified second object. This feature can be useful in both\nequations and schematic diagrams. Additionally, the scaling and\nstretching commands offer constraints on maximum width and/or\nminimum aspect ratio, which are often used to preserve\nlegibility or for the sake of general appearance.\n",
