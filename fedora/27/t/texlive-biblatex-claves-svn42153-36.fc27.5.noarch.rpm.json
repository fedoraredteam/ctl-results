            "Description": "\nWhen studying antic and medieval literature, we may find many\ndifferent texts published with the same title, or, in contrary,\nthe same text published with different titles. To avoid\nconfusion, scholars have published claves, which are books\nlisting ancient texts, identifying them by an identifier -- a\nnumber or a string of text. For example, for early\nChristianity, we have the Bibliotheca Hagiographica Graeca, the\nClavis Apocryphorum Novi Testamenti and other claves. It could\nbe useful to print the identifier of a texts in one specific\nclavis, or in many claves. The package allows us to create new\nfield for different claves, and to present all these fields in\na consistent way.\n",
