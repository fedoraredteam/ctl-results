            "Description": "\nPackage graphicx provides a useful keyword viewport which\nallows to show just a part of an image. However, one needs to\nput there the actual coordinates of the viewport window.\nSometimes it is useful to have relative coordinates as\nfractions of natural size. For example, one may want to print a\nlarge image on a spread, putting a half on a verso page, and\nanother half on the next recto page. For this one would need a\nviewport occupying exactly one half of the file's bounding box,\nwhatever the actual width of the image may be. This package\nadds a new keyword rviewport to the graphicx package\nspecifiying Relative Viewport for graphics inclusion: a window\ndefined by the given fractions of the natural width and height\nof the image.\n",
