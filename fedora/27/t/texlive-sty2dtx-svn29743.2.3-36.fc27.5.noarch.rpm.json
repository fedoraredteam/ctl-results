            "Description": "\nThe package provides a Perl script that converts a .sty file\n(LaTeX package) to .dtx format (documented LaTeX source), by\nsurrounding macro definitions with macro and macrocode\nenvironments. The macro name is automatically inserted as an\nargument to the macro environemnt. Code lines outside macro\ndefinitions are wrapped only in macrocode environments. Empty\nlines are removed. The script should not be thought to be fool\nproof and 100% accurate but rather as a good start to the\nbusiness of making a .dtx file from an undocumented style file.\nFull .dtx files are generated. A template based on the skeleton\nfile from 'dtxtut' is used. User level macros are added\nautomatically to the 'Usage' section of the .dtx file. A\ncorresponding .ins file can be generated as well.\n",
