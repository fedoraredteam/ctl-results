The\n\"arguments\" are stored as if they had been saved by \\savebox or\nby the lrbox environment. Grouping tokens \\bgroup and \\egroup\nmay be used, which allows the user to have the beginning and\nend of a group in different macro invocations, or to place them\nin the begin and end code of an environment. Arguments may\ncontain verbatim material or other special use of characters.\nThe macros were designed for use within other macros.\n",
