            "Description": "\nThe macros support the construction of diagrams, such as those\nthat appear in category theory texts. The user gives the list\nof vertices and arrows to be included, just as when composing a\nmatrix, and the program takes care of computing the dimensions\nof the arrows and realizing the pagesetting. All the user has\nto do about the arrows is to specify their type (monomorphism,\npair of adjoint arrows, etc.) and their direction (north, south-\neast, etc.); 12 types and 32 directions are available.\n",
