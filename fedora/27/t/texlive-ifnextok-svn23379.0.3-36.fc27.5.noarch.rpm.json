This has the\npotential to surprise users, since it can produce really\nunwanted effects. A common example occurs with brackets\nstarting a line following \\\\: the command looks for an optional\nargument, whereas the user wants the brackets to be printed.\nThe package offers commands and options for modifying this\nbehaviour, maybe limited to certain parts of the document\nsource.\n",
