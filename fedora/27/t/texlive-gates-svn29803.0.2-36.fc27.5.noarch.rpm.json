            "Description": "\nThe package provides the means of writing code in a modular\nfashion: big macros or functions are divided into small chunks\n(called gates) with names, which can be externally controlled\n(e.g. they can be disabled, subjected to conditionals,\nloops...) and/or augmented with new chunks. Thus complex code\nmay easily be customised without having to rewrite it, or even\nunderstand its implementation: the behavior of existing gates\ncan be modified, and new ones can be added, without endangering\nthe whole design. This allows code to be hacked in ways the\noriginal authors might have never envisioned. The gates package\nis implemented independently for both TeX and Lua. The TeX\nimplementation, running in any current environment, requires\nthe texapi package, whereas the Lua version can be run with any\nLua interpreter, not just LuaTeX.\n",
