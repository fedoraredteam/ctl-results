            "Description": "\nThis program makes PNG and/or GIF graphics from DVI files as\nobtained from TeX and its relatives. Its benefits include:\nSpeed. It offers very fast rendering of DVI as bitmap files,\nwhich makes it suitable for generating large amounts of images\non-the-fly, as needed in preview-latex, WeBWorK and others; It\ndoes not read the postamble, so it can be started before TeX\nfinishes. There is a --follow switch that makes dvipng wait at\nend-of-file for further output, unless it finds the POST marker\nthat indicates the end of the DVI; Interactive query of\noptions. dvipng can read options interactively through stdin,\nand all options are usable. It is even possible to change the\ninput file through this interface. Support for PK, VF,\nPostScript Type1, and TrueType fonts, colour specials, and\ninclusion of PostScript, PNG, JPEG or GIF images.\n",
