The result is stored as a PostScript\nobject and may be plotted later using macros from other\nPSTricks packages, such as \\listplot (pst-plot) and\n\\listplotThreeD (pst-3dplot), or may be further processed by\nuser-defined PostScript procedures. Optionally, the computed\nstate vectors can be written as a table to a text file.\n",
