The references in the text are linked\ndirectly to the corresponding bibliography entry, and if a URL\nis defined in the entry within the BibTeX database file, then\nthe generated bibliography entry is linked to this. The package\nprovides three different style files derived from each of the\nstandard plain.bst and alpha.bst, as well as two style files\nderived from abbrv.bst and unsrt.bst (i.e., eight in total).\n",
