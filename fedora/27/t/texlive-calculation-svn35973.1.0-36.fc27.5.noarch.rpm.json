            "Description": "\nThe calculation environment formats reasoned calculations, also\ncalled calculational proofs. The notion of reasoned\ncalculations or calculational proofs was originally advocated\nby Wim Feijen and Edsger Dijkstra. The package accepts options\nfleqn and leqno (with the same effect as the LaTeX options\nfleqn and leqno, or may inherit the options from the document\nclass). It allows steps and expressions to be numbered (by\nLaTeX equation numbers, obeying the LaTeX \\label command to\nrefer to these numbers), and a step doesn't take vertical space\nif its hint is empty. An expression in a calculation can be\ngiven a comment; it is placed at the side opposite to the\nequation numbers. Calculations are allowed inside hints\nalthough numbering and commenting is then disabled.\n",
