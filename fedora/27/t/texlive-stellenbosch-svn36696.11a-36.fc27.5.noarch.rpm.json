            "Description": "\nThe usthesis class/style files are provided to typeset reports,\ntheses and dissertations that conform to the requirements of\nthe Engineering Faculty of the University of Stellenbosch. The\nclass file usthesis.cls is based on the standard LaTeX book\nclass, while usthesis.sty is a style file to be loaded on top\nof the very powerful memoir class. Both options give identical\noutput, but the benefit of the using memoir is that it has many\nadditional command and environments for formatting and\nprocessing of a document. Usthesis is primarily concerned with\nthe formatting of the front matter such as the title page,\nabstract, etc. and a decent page layout on A4 paper. It also\nworks together with the babel package to provide language\noptions to typeset documents in Afrikaans or in English.\nAdditional packages are provided for bibliographic matter, note\ntitle pages, lists of symbols, as well as various graphic files\nfor logos.\n",
