It also frees the user from inventing\ndescriptive names for new files that fit into the confines of\nfile system conventions. Sketch is a 3D scene description\nlanguage by Eugene K. Ressler and can generate TikZ and\nPSTricks code. ESK behaves in a similar fashion to EMP (which\nencapsulates Metapost files), and was in fact developed from\nit.\n",
