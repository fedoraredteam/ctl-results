            "Description": "\nWhile pdfLaTeX has a number of nice features, its primary\nshortcoming relative to standard LaTeX+dvips is that it is\nunable to read ordinary Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files,\nthe most common graphics format in the LaTeX world. Purifyeps\nconverts EPS files into a 'purified' form that can be read by\nboth LaTeX+dvips and pdfLaTeX. The trick is that the standard\nLaTeX2e graphics packages can parse MetaPost-produced EPS\ndirectly. Hence, purifyeps need only convert an arbitrary EPS\nfile into the same stylized format that MetaPost outputs.\n",
