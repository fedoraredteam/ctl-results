The package provides two\ncommands for marking: \\marksthe and \\marksthecs, which have *\nforms which disable expansion; new mark registers are allocated\nas needed. Syntax is closely modelled on the \\marks primitive.\nFour commands are provided for retrieving the marks registers'\ncontent: \\thefirstmarks, \\thebotmarks, thetopmarks and\n\\getthemarks; and the command \\ifmarksequal is available for\ncomparing the content of marks registers. The package requires\nan e-TeX-enabled engine, and the etex package.\n",
