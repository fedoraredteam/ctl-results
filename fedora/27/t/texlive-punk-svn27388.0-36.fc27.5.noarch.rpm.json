Knuth\nfelt it was (in 1988) time to design a replacement for his\ndesigns of the 1970s, and came up with this font! The fonts are\ndistributed as Metafont source. The package offers LaTeX\nsupport by Rohit Grover, from an original by Sebastian Rahtz,\nwhich is slightly odd in claiming that the fonts are T1-\nencoded. A (possibly) more rational support package is to be\nfound in punk-latex\n",
