So, for example, if you want\nnothing but the figure and table environments in your document,\nyou can enclose the whole document with an xcomment environment\nthat excludes everything but. This is a lot easier than\nexcluding the chunks of text between the environments you want,\nor creating an entire document containing only those\nenvironments. The package was previously part of the seminar\nbundle for typesetting presentations.\n",
