            "Description": "\nThe package supports drawing proof trees of the kind often used\nin introductory logic classes, especially those aimed at\nstudents without strong mathemtical backgrounds. Hodges (1991)\nis one example of a text which uses this system. When teaching\nsuch a system it is especially useful to annotate the tree with\nline numbers, justifications and explanations of branch\nclosures. prooftrees provides a single environment, prooftree,\nand a variety of tools for annotating, customising and\nhighlighting such trees. A cross-referencing system is provided\nfor trees which cite line numbers in justifications for proof\nlines or branch closures. prooftrees is based on forest and,\nhence, TikZ. The package requires version 2.0.2 of Forest for\nexpected results and will not work with version 1.\n",
