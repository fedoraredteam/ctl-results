            "Description": "\nThe package provides the means to extract specific content from\na source document and write that to a target document. One\ncould, for instance, use this to extract all exercises from\nlecture notes and generate an exercises book on the fly. The\npackage also provides an environment which writes its body\nentirely to the target file. Another environment will write to\nthe target file, but will also execute the body. This allows to\nshare code (for instance, a preamble) between the source\ndocument and the target file. Finally, the package provides an\ninterface to conditionally extract content. With a single\npackage option, one can specify exactly which commands (counted\nfrom the start of the document) should be extracted and which\nnot. This might be useful for extracting specific slides from a\npresentation and use them in a new file.\n",
