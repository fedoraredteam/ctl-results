            "Description": "\nPSfragX offers a mechanism to embed \\psfrag commands, as\nprovided by the psfrag package, into the EPS file itself. Each\ntime a graphic is included, the EPS file is scanned. If some\ntagged lines are found, they are used to define the psfrag\nreplacements that should be performed automatically. In\naddition, a similar mechanism holds for overpic objects. These\nare picture objects superimposed on the included graphic. A\nsimilar mechanism is implemented in psfrag itself (but\ndeprecated in the documentation), but psfragx offers much more\nflexibility. For example, if babel is used, it is possible to\ndefine different replacements corresponding to different\nlanguages. The replacements to take into account will be\nselected on the basis of the current language of the document.\nA Matlab script (LaPrint) is provided, to export an EPS file\nwith psfragx annotations ready embedded.\n",
