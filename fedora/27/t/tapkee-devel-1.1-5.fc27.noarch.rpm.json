            "Description": "\nTapkee is a C++ template library for dimensionality reduction with\nsome bias on spectral methods.  The Tapkee origins from the code\ndeveloped during GSoC 2011 as the part of the Shogun machine learning\ntoolbox.  The project aim is to provide efficient and flexible\nstandalone library for dimensionality reduction which can be easily\nintegrated to existing codebases.  Tapkee leverages capabilities of\neffective Eigen3 linear algebra library and optionally makes use of\nthe ARPACK eigensolver.  The library uses CoverTree and VP-tree\ndata-structures to compute nearest neighbors.  To achieve greater\nflexibility we provide a callback interface which decouples dimension\nreduction algorithms from the data representation and storage schemes.\n\nTapkee provides implementations of the following dimension reduction\nmethods:\n\n  * Locally Linear Embedding and Kernel Locally Linear Embedding\n    (LLE/KLLE)\n  * Neighborhood Preserving Embedding (NPE)\n  * Local Tangent Space Alignment (LTSA)\n  * Linear Local Tangent Space Alignment (LLTSA)\n  * Hessian Locally Linear Embedding (HLLE)\n  * Laplacian eigenmaps\n  * Locality Preserving Projections\n  * Diffusion map\n  * Isomap and landmark Isomap\n  * Multidimensional scaling and landmark Multidimensional scaling\n    (MDS/lMDS)\n  * Stochastic Proximity Embedding (SPE)\n  * PCA and randomized PCA\n  * Kernel PCA (kPCA)\n  * Random projection\n  * Factor analysis\n  * t-SNE\n  * Barnes-Hut-SNE\n",
