It focuses on the\nAmerican style of performing these algorithms. It is written\nmostly in low-level TeX, with the goal that it should run in\neither plain TeX or LaTeX, but there are two constructions that\ncurrently prevent this. It is highly configurable, with macros\nand lengths described in the documentation.\n",
