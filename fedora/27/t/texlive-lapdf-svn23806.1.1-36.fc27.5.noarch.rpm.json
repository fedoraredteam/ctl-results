            "Description": "\nThe package provides the means to use PDF drawing primitives to\nproduce high quality, colored graphics. It uses Bezier curves\n(integral and rational) from degree one to seven, allows TeX\ntypesetting in the graphic, offers most of the standard math\nfunctions, allows plotting normal, parametric and polar\nfunctions. The package has linear, logx, logy, logxy and polar\ngrids with many specs; it can rotate, clip and do many nice\nthings easily it has two looping commands for programming and\nmany instructive example files. The package requires pdfTeX but\notherwise only depends on the calc package.\n",
