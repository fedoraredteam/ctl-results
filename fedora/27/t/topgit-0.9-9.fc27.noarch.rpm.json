In fact, it is designed especially for the case when\nyou maintain a queue of third-party patches on top of another (perhaps\nGit-controlled) project and want to easily organize, maintain and\nsubmit them - TopGit achieves that by keeping a separate topic branch\nfor each patch and providing few tools to maintain the branches.\n",
