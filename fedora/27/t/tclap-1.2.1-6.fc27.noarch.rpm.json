            "Description": "\ntclap is a small, flexible library that provides a simple interface for\ndefining and accessing command line arguments. It was initially inspired by\nthe user friendly CLAP library. The difference is that this library is\ntemplate-only, so the argument class is type independent. Type independence\navoids identical-except-for-type objects, such as IntArg, FloatArg, and\nStringArg. While the library is not strictly compliant with the GNU or\nPOSIX standards, it is close.\n\ntclap is written in ANSI C++ and is meant to be compatible with any\nstandards-compliant C++ compiler. The library is implemented entirely\nin header files making it easy to use and distribute with other software.\n\ntclap is now a mature, stable, and feature rich package. It probably will not\nsee much further development aside from bug fixes and compatibility updates.\n",
