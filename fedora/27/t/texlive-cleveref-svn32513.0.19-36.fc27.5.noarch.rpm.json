The formats\nused may be customised in the preamble of a document; babel\nsupport is available (though the choice of languages remains\nlimited: currently Danish, Dutch, English, French, German,\nItalian, Norwegian, Russian, Spanish and Ukranian). The package\nalso offers a means of referencing a list of references, each\nformatted according to its type. In such lists, it can collapse\nsequences of numerically-consecutive labels to a reference\nrange.\n",
