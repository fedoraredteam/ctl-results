            "Description": "\nThe snapshot package helps the owner of a LaTeX document obtain\na list of the external dependencies of the document, in a form\nthat can be embedded at the top of the document. It provides a\nsnapshot of the current processing context of the document,\ninsofar as it can be determined from inside LaTeX. If a\ndocument contains such a dependency list, then it becomes\npossible to arrange that the document be processed always with\nthe same versions of everything, in order to ensure the same\noutput. This could be useful for someone wanting to keep a\nLaTeX document on hand and consistently reproduce an identical\nDVI file from it, on the fly; or for someone wanting to shield\na document during the final stages of its production cycle from\nunexpected side effects of routine upgrades to the TeX system.\n",
