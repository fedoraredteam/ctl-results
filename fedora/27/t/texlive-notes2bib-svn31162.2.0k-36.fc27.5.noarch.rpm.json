The package allows\nfootnotes and endnotes to be moved into the bibliography in the\nsame way. The package can be used with natbib and biblatex as\nwell as plain LaTeX citations. Both sorted and unsorted\nbibliography styles are supported. The package uses the LaTeX 3\nmacros and the associated xpackages bundle. It also makes use\nof the e-TeX extensions (any post-2005 LaTeX distribution will\nprovide these by default, but users of older systems may need\nto use an elatex command or equivalent). The package relies on\nLaTeX 3 support from the l3kernel and l3packages bundles.\n",
