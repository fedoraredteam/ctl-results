As in\nbuilding a bibliography with BibTEX, additional external\nprogrammes are invoked. In this case they are used to create a\nPDF file (\\PDFcontainer) that will contain all the graphics\nmaterial. In the final document these contents will be inserted\ninstead of the original PostScript code. The package works with\npstricks and requires a recent version of the preview package.\n",
