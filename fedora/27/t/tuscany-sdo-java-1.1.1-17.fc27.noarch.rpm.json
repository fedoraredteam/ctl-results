SDO does the following:\n\n- Simplifies the J2EE data programming model\n- Abstracts data in a service oriented architecture (SOA)\n- Unifies data application development\n- Supports and integrates XML\n- Incorporates J2EE patterns and best practices\n\nWith SDO, you do not need to be familiar with a\ntechnology-specific API in order to access and utilize data.\nYou need to know only one API, the SDO API, which lets you\nwork with data from multiple data sources, including\nrelational databases, entity EJB components, XML pages, Web\nservices, the Java Connector Architecture, JavaServer Pages\npages, and more.\n\nThis package contains only a Java API of SDO 2.1 spec.\nEclipseLink is a implementation of this spec.\n",
