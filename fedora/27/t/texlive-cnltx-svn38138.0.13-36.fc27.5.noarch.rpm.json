The bundle also provides several other small ideas of\nmine such as a mechansim for providing abbreviations etc. Not\nat least it provides a number of programming tools. The\nintention behind this bundle mainly is a selfish one:\ndocumenting my own packages. The bundle contains an index style\nfile cnltx.ist that should be placed in a directory in a TDS\nmakeindex directory.\n",
