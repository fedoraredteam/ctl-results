            "Description": "\nGrid setting -- also known as strict in-register setting -- is\nsomething, that should be done for a lot of documents but is\nnot easy using LaTeX. The package helps to get the information\nneeded for grid setting. It does not implement auto grid\nsetting, but there is a command \\vskipnextgrid, that moves to\nthe next grid position. This may be enough under some\ncircumstances, but in other circumstances it may fail. Thus\ngridset is only one more step for grid setting, not a complete\nsolution.\n",
