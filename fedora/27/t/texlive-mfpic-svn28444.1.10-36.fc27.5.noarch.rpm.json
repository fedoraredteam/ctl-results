The\ncommands generate a Meta-language file, which may be processed\nby Metapost (or even Metafont). The resulting image file will\nbe read back in to the document to place the picture at the\npoint where the original (La)TeX commands appeared. Note that\nthe ability to use Metapost here means that the package works\nequally well in LaTeX and PDFLaTeX.\n",
