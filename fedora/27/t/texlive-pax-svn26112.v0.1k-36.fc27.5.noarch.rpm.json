            "Description": "\nIf PDF files are included using pdfTeX, PDF annotations are\nstripped. The pax project offers a solution without altering\npdfTeX. A Java program (pax.jar) parses the PDF file that will\nlater be included. The program then writes the data of the\nannotations into a file that can be read by TeX. The LaTeX\npackage pax extends the graphics package to support the scheme:\nif a PDF file is included, the package looks for the file with\nthe annotation data, reads them and puts the annotations in the\nright place. Project status: experimental\n",
