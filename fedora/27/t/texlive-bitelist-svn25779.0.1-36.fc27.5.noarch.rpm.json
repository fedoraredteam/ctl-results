I.e.,\nfor given token lists s, t return b and the shortest a, such\nthat t = a s b. The package's mechanism differs from those of\npackages providing similar features, in the following ways: the\nmethod uses TeX's mechanism of reading delimited macro\nparameters; splitting macros work by pure expansion, without\nassignments; the operation is carried out in a single macro\ncall. A variant of the operation is provided, that retains\nouter braces.\n",
