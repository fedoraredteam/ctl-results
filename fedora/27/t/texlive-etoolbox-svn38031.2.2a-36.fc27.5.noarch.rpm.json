It provides\nLaTeX frontends to some of the new primitives provided by e-TeX\nas well as some generic tools which are not strictly related to\ne-TeX but match the profile of this package. Note that the\ninitial versions of this package were released under the name\nelatex. The package provides functions that seem to offer\nalternative ways of implementing some LaTeX kernel commands;\nnevertheless, the package will not modify any part of the LaTeX\nkernel.\n",
