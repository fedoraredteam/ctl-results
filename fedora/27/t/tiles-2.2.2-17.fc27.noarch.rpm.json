            "Description": "\nApache Tiles is a templating framework built to simplify the\ndevelopment of web application user interfaces. Tiles allows\nauthors to define page fragments which can be assembled into\na complete page at runtime. These fragments, or tiles, can\nbe used as simple includes in order to reduce the duplication\nof common page elements or embedded within other tiles to\ndevelop a series of reusable templates. These templates\nstreamline the development of a consistent look and feel\nacross an entire application. Tiles grew in popularity as a\ncomponent of the popular Struts framework. It has since been\nextracted from Struts and is now integrated with various\nframeworks, such as Struts 2 and Shale.\n",
