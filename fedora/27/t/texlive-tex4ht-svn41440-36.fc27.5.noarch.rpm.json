Instead, Tex4ht uses\n(La)TeX itself (with an extra macro package) to produce a non-\nstandard DVI file that it can then process. This technique\nallows TeX4ht to approach the robustness characteristic of\nrestricted-syntax systems such as hyperlatex and gellmu. Note\nthat CTAN no longer holds the definitive sources of the\npackage: see the 'Readme' file.\n",
