            "Description": "\nA font that contains all the symbols of the famous Disc of\nPhaistos, together with a LaTeX package. The disc was 'printed'\nby stamping the wet clay with some sort of punches, probably\naround 1700 BCE. The font is available in Adobe Type 1 and\nOpenType formats (the latter using the Unicode positions for\nthe symbols). There are those who believe that this Cretan\nscript was used to 'write' Greek (it is known, for example,\nthat the rather later Cretan Linear B script was used to write\nGreek), but arguments for other languages have been presented.\n",
