            "Description": "\nThe (Sherlock Holmes) book contains a code which uses dancing\nmen as glyphs. The alphabet as given is not complete, lacking\nf, j, k, q, u, w, x and z, so those letters in the font are not\ndue to Conan Doyle. The code required word endings to be marked\nby the dancing man representing the last letter to be holding a\nflag: these are coded as A-Z.\nthaTiStOsaYsentenceSiNthEcodElooKlikEthiS. In some cases, the\nman has no arms, making it impossible for him to hold a flag.\nIn these cases, he is wearing a flag on his hat in the\n'character'. The font is distributed as Metafont source; it\nworks poorly in modern environments, and could do with expert\nattention (if you are interested, please contact the CTAN team\nfor details).\n",
