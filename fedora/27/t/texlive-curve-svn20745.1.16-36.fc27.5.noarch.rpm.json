            "Description": "\nCurVe is a class for writing a CV, with configuration for the\nlanguage in which you write. The class provides a set of\ncommands to create rubrics, entries in these rubrics etc. CurVe\nthen format the CV (possibly splitting it onto multiple pages,\nrepeating the titles etc), which is usually the most painful\npart of CV writing. Another nice feature of CurVe is its\nability to manage different CV 'flavours' simultaneously. It is\noften the case that you want to maintain slightly divergent\nversions of your CV at the same time, in order to emphasize on\ndifferent aspects of your background. CurVe also comes with\nsupport for use with AUC-TeX.\n",
