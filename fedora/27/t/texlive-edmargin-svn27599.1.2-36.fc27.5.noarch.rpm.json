Endnotes can either be marked in the text,\nor with marginal references to the page in the note sections\nwhere the note is to be found. Notes can be set in individual\nparagraphs, or in block paragraph mode (where there are many\nshort notes). Note sections will have running headers of the\nform \"Textual notes to pp. xx--yy\". New note sections can be\ncreated on the fly. There are predefined endnote sections for\ntextual notes, emendations, and explanatory notes.\n",
