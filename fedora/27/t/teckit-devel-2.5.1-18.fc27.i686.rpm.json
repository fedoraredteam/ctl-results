            "Description": "\nTECkit is a low-level toolkit intended to be used by other\napplications that need to perform encoding conversions (e.g., when\nimporting legacy data into a Unicode-based application). The\nprimary component of the TECkit package is therefore a library that\nperforms conversions; this is the \"TECkit engine\". The engine\nrelies on mapping tables in a specific binary format (for which\ndocumentation is available); there is a compiler that creates such\ntables from a human-readable mapping description (a simple text file).\n",
