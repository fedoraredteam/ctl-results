The\npackage then patches the \\- (discretionary hyphen command) to\nuse the current hyphen character (which may be different from\nthan the default, which is the character at the ASCII hyphen\nslot), and loads the realscripts to patch the \\textsuperscript\ncommand (from the LaTeX kernel) and the \\textsubscript command\n(from the fixltx2e package). The package is loaded by the\nfontspec package, so that it should not ordinarily be necessary\nto load it explicitly. The package relies on the metalogo\npackage for typesetting the XeTeX and XeLaTeX logos.\n",
