            "Description": "\nThe package combines a document's columns into a PDF \"article\nthread\". PDF readers that support this mechanism (probably\nAdobe Acrobat/Reader only) can be instructed to scroll\nautomatically from column to column, which facilitates on-\nscreen reading of two-column documents. Even for single-column\ndocuments, threadcol supports the creation of multiple article\nthreads, which help organize discontiguous but logically\nrelated regions of text into a form that the user can scroll\nthrough as if its contents were contiguous.\n",
