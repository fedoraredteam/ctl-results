            "Description": "\nThe rtkinenc package is functionally similar to the standard\nLaTeX package inputenc: both set up active characters so that\nan input character outside the range of 7-bit visible ASCII is\ncoverted into one or more corresponding LaTeX commands. The\nmain difference lies in that rtkinenc allows the user to\nspecify a fallback procedure to use when the text command\ncorresponding to some input character isn't available. Names of\ncommands in rtkinenc have been selected so that it can read\ninputenc encoding definition files, and the aim is that\nrtkinenc should be backwards compatible with inputenc. rtkinenc\nis not a new version of inputenc though, nor is it part of\nstandard LaTeX. For an example of how rtkinenc is used, the\nuser may look at the tclldoc class.\n",
