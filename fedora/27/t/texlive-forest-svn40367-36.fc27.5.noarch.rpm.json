            "Description": "\nThe package is provides a PGF/TikZ-based mechanism for drawing\nlinguistic (and other kinds of) trees. Its main features are: a\npacking algorithm which can produce very compact trees; a user-\nfriendly interface consisting of the familiar bracket encoding\nof trees plus the key-value interface to option-setting; many\ntree-formatting options, with control over option values of\nindividual nodes and mechanisms for their manipulation; the\npossibility to decorate the tree using the full power of\nPGF/TikZ; and an externalization mechanism sensitive to code-\nchanges.\n",
