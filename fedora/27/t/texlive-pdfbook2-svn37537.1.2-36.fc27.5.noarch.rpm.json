            "Description": "\nThis python program creates print-ready PDF files from some\ninput PDF files for booklet printing. The resulting files need\nto be printed in landscape/long edge double sided printing. The\ndefault paper format depends on the locale and is chosen by\npdfjam. It can be chosen using the --paper option. Before the\npdf is composed, the input file is cropped to the relevant area\nin order to discard unnecessary white spaces. In this process,\nall pages are cropped to the same dimensions. Extra margins can\nbe defined at the edges of the booklet and in the middle where\nthe binding occurs. The output is written to INPUT-book.pdf.\nExisting files will be overwritten. All input files are\nprocessed seperately.\n",
