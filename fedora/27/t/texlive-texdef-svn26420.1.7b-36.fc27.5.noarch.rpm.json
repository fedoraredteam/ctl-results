            "Description": "\nThe (Perl) script displays the definition of (La)TeX command\nsequences/macros. Various options allow the selection of the\nused class and package files and other things which can have\ninfluence on the definition (before/after the preamble, inside\nan environment, ...). The script creates a temporary TeX file\nwhich is then compiled using (La)TeX to find the '\\meaning' of\nthe command sequence. The result is formatted and presented to\nthe user. Length or number command sequences (dimensions,\n\\char..., count registers, ...) are recognized and the\ncontained value is also shown (using \\the). Special definitions\nlike protected macros are also recognized and the underlying\nmacros are shown as well. The script will show plain TeX\ndefinitions by default. LaTeX and ConTeXt are supported,\nincluding flavours (pdf(la)tex, lua(la)tex, xe(la)tex, ...).\nThe flavour can be selected using an command line option or\nover the script name: latexdef will use LaTeX as default, etc.\n",
