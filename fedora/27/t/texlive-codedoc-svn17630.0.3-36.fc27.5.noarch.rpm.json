The documentation is\nprepared like any other LaTeX document and the code to be\ncommented verbatim is simply delimited by an environment. When\nan option is turned on in the class options, this code is\nwritten to the desired file(s). The class also includes fully\ncustomizable verbatim environments which provide the author\nwith separate commands to typeset the material and/or to\nexecute it.\n",
