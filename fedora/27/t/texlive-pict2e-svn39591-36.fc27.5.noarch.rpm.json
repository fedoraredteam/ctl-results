For a long time, LaTeX has\nincluded a 'pict2e package' that merely produced an apologetic\nerror message. The new package extends the existing LaTeX\npicture environment, using the familiar technique (cf. the\ngraphics and color packages) of driver files (at present,\ndrivers for PostScript output from LaTeX, and for use with\nPDFLaTeX are available). The package documentation has a fair\nnumber of examples of use, showing where things are improved by\ncomparison with the LaTeX picture environment.\n",
