            "Description": "\nLollipop is \"TeX made easy\" -- it is a macro package that\nfunctions as a toolbox for writing TeX macros. Its main aim is\nto make macro writing so easy that implementing a fully new\nlayout in TeX would become a matter of less than an hour for an\naverage document. The aim is that such a task could be\naccomplished by someone with only a very basic training in TeX\nprogramming. Thus, Lollipop aims to make structured text\nformatting available in environments where typical users would\nswitch to WYSIWYG packages for the freedom that such a\nmechanism offers. In addition, development of support for\nLollipop documents written in RTL languages (such as Persian)\nis underway.\n",
