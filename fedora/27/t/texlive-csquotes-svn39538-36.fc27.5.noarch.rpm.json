            "Description": "\nThis package provides advanced facilities for inline and\ndisplay quotations. It is designed for a wide range of tasks\nranging from the most simple applications to the more complex\ndemands of formal quotations. The facilities include commands,\nenvironments, and user-definable 'smart quotes' which\ndynamically adjust to their context. Quotation marks are\nswitched automatically if quotations are nested and they can be\nadjusted to the current language if the babel package is\navailable. There are additional facilities designed to cope\nwith the more specific demands of academic writing, especially\nin the humanities and the social sciences. All quote styles as\nwell as the optional active quotes are freely configurable. The\npackage is dependent on e-TeX, and requires the author's\netoolbox package.\n",
