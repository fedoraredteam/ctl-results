The listing\nenvironment is tailored for including listings of computer\nprogram source code into documents. The main advantages over\nthe original verbatim environment are: environments\nautomatically fixes leading whitespace so that the environment\nand program listing can be indented with the rest of the\ndocument source, and; listing environments may easily be\ncustomised and extended.\n",
