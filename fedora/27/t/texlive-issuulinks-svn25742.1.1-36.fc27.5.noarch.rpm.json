Due to the way it is\nimplemented, internal links in these documents are not allowed.\nInstead, they must be converted to external ones in the form\nhttp://issuu.com/action/page?page=PAGENUMBER. The package\npatches hyperref to produce external links in the required form\ninstead of internal links created by \\ref, \\cite and other\ncommands. Since the package redefines the internals of\nhyperref, it must be loaded it AFTER hyperref.\n",
