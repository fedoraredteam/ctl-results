Packages\nprovided in this release are: l3keys2e, which makes the\nfacilities of the kernel module l3keys available for use by\nLaTeX 2e packages; xfrac, which provides flexible split-level\nfractions; xparse, which provides a high-level interface for\ndeclaring document commands; and xtemplate, which provides a\nmeans of defining generic functions using a key-value syntax.\nAll the files of the bundle are also available in the\nSubversion (SVN) repository of the LaTeX3 Project. The bundle\non CTAN is based on a snapshot of the SVN repository; it should\nbe used with copies of the l3kernel at SVN version 6001 or\nlater.\n",
