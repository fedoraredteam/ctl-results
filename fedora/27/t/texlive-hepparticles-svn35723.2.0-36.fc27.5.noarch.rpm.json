            "Description": "\nHEPparticles is a set of macros for typesetting high energy\nparticle names, to meet the following criteria: 1. The main\nparticle name is a Roman or Greek symbol, to be typeset in\nupright font in normal contexts. 2. Additionally a superscript\nand/or subscript may follow the main symbol. 3. Particle\nresonances may also have a resonance specifier which is typeset\nin parentheses following the main symbol. In general the\nparentheses may also be followed by sub- and superscripts. 4.\nThe particle names are expected to be used both in and out of\nmathematical contexts. 5. If the surrounding text is bold or\nitalic then the particle name should adapt to that context as\nbest as possible (this may not be possible for Greek symbols).\nA consequence of point 5 is that the well-known problems with\nboldness of particle names in section titles, headers and\ntables of contents automatically disappear if these macros are\nused.\n",
