It was created as\nan alternative version of the Kurier typeface, which was\ndesigned in 1975 for a diploma in typeface design at the Warsaw\nAcademy of Fine Arts under the supervision of Roman\nTomaszewski. This distribution contains a significantly\nextended set of characters covering the following modern\nalphabets: latin (including Vietnamese), Cyrillic and Greek as\nwell as a number of additional symbols (including mathematical\nsymbols). The fonts are prepared in Type 1 and OpenType\nformats. For use with TeX the following encoding files have\nbeen prepared: T1 (ec), T2 (abc), and OT2--Cyrillic, T5\n(Vietnamese), OT4, QX, texansi and nonstandard (IL2 for the\nCzech fonts), as well as supporting macros and files defining\nfonts for LaTeX.\n",
