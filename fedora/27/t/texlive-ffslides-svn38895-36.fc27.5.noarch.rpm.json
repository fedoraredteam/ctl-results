            "Description": "\nThe ffslides (\"freeform slides\") class is intended to make it\neasier to place various types of content freely on the page,\nand therefore easier to design documents with a strong visual\ncomponent: presentations, posters, research or lecture notes,\nand so on. The goal of the class is to be less rigid and less\ncomplex than some of the popular presentation-making options.\nIt is essentially a small set of macros added to the article\nclass. A well-organized template file is included, and the\ndocumentation is itself an extensive example of the class's\ncapabilities.\n",
