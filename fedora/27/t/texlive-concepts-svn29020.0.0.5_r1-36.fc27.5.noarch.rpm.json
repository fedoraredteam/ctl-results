This is particularly useful for\nscientific papers (for example, in physics, mathematics or\ncomputer science), which may introduce several concepts (with\ntheir own symbols). The package's commands allow the user to\ndefine a concept (typically, near its first use), and will\nensure consistent use throughout the document. The package\ndepends on several other packages; while these are fairly\ncommon packages, the user should check the package's README\nfile for the complete list.\n",
