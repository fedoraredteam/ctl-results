Supported encodings are:\nT1 (Latin), T2A (Cyrillic), LGR (Greek) and TS1. The package\nalso includes Unicode virtual fonts for use with Omega. The\nfont set is not a replacement for any of the other Computer\nModern-based font sets (for example, cm-super for Latin and\nCyrillic, or cbgreek for Greek), since it is available at a\nsingle size only; it offers a compact set for 'general'\nworking. The fonts themselves are encoded to external\nstandards, and virtual fonts are provided for use with TeX.\n",
