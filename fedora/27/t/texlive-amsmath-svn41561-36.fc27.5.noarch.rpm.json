It adapts for use in LaTeX most of the\nmathematical features found in AMS-TeX; it is highly\nrecommendsd as an adjunct to serious mathematical typesetting\nin LaTeX. When amsmath is loaded, AMS-LaTeX packages amsbsy\n(for bold symbols), amsopn (for operator names) and amstext\n(for text embdedded in mathematics) are also loaded. Amsmath is\npart of the LaTeX required distribution; however, several\ncontributed packages add still further to its appeal; examples\nare empheq, which provides functions for decorating and\nhighlighting mathematics, and ntheorem, for specifying theorem\n(and similar) definitions.\n",
