A document may select a single language to be\nsupported, or it may select several, in which case the document\nmay switch from one language to another in a variety of ways.\nBabel uses contributed configuration files that provide the\ndetail of what has to be done for each language. Users of XeTeX\nare advised to use polyglossia rather than Babel.\n",
