            "Description": "\nA collection of ways to change the typesetting of footnotes.\nThe package provides means of changing the layout of the\nfootnotes themselves (including setting them in 'paragraphs' --\nthe para option), a way to number footnotes per page (the\nperpage option), to make footnotes disappear in a 'moving'\nargument (stable option) and to deal with multiple references\nto footnotes from the same place (multiple option). The package\nalso has a range of techniques for labelling footnotes with\nsymbols rather than numbers. Some of the functions of the\npackage are overlap with the functionality of other packages.\nThe para option is also provided by the manyfoot and bigfoot\npackages, though those are both also portmanteau packages.\n(Don't be seduced by fnpara, whose implementation is improved\nby the present package.) The perpage option is also offered by\nfootnpag and by the rather more general-purpose perpage\n",
