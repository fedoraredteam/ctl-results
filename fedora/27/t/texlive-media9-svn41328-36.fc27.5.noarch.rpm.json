Playback of\nmultimedia files uses the built-in Flash Player of Adobe Reader\nand does, therefore, not depend on external plug-ins. Flash\nPlayer supports the efficient H.264 codec for video\ncompression. The package is based on the RichMedia Annotation,\nan Adobe addition to the PDF specification. It replaces the now\nobsolete movie15 package.\n",
