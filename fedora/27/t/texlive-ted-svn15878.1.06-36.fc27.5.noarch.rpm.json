            "Description": "\nJust like sed is a stream editor, ted is a token list editor.\nActually, it is not as powerfull as sed, but its main feature\nis that it really works with tokens, not only characters. The\nted package provides two user macros: \\Substitute and\n\\ShowTokens. The first is maybe the most useful: it performs\nsubstitutions in token lists (even inside braces). The second\ndisplays each token of the list (one per line) with its catcode\n(in the list, not just the current one), and can be useful for\ndebugging or for TeX learners. Ted is designed to work well\neven if strange tokens (that is, unusual {charcode, catcode}\npairs or tokens with a confusing meaning) occur in the list.\n",
