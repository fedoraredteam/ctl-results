It supports a large variety of movie and music\nformats which abstract away the work, handling all the different cases, so all\nyou have to do is access file.Tag.Title, file.Tag.Lyrics, or my personal\nfavorite file.Tag.Pictures. But don't think all this abstraction is gonna keep\nyou from tagging's greatest gems. You can still get to a specific tag type's\nfeatures with just a few lines of code.\n",
