            "Description": "\nThe package uses the author's package collectbox to define\nvariants of common box related macros which read the content as\nreal box and not as macro argument. This enables the use of\nverbatim or other special material as part of this content. The\nprovided macros have the same names as the original versions\nbut start with an upper-case letter instead. The \"long-form\"\nmacros, like \\Makebox, can also be used as environments, but\nnot the \"short-form\" macros, like \\Mbox. However, normally the\nlong form uses the short form anyway when no optional arguments\nare used.\n",
