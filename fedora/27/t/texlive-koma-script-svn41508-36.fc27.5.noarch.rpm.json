            "Description": "\nThe KOMA-Script bundle provides replacements for the article,\nreport, and book classes with emphasis on typography and\nversatility. There is also a letter class. The bundle also\noffers: a package for calculating type areas in the way laid\ndown by the typographer Jan Tschichold, a package for easily\nchanging and defining page styles, a package scrdate for\ngetting not only the current date but also the name of the day,\nand a package scrtime for getting the current time. All these\npackages may be used not only with KOMA-Script classes but also\nwith the standard classes. Since every package has its own\nversion number, the version number quoted only refers to the\nversion of scrbook, scrreprt, scrartcl, scrlttr2 and typearea\n(which are the main parts of the bundle).\n",
