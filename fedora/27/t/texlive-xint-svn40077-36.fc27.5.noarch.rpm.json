            "Description": "\nThe bundle provides nine packages: xintcore, which provides\nexpandable TeX macros that implement the basic arithmetic\noperations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and\ndivision, as applied to arbitrarily long numbers represented as\nchains of digits with an optional minus sign; xint, which\nextends xintcore with more big integer operations; xinttools,\nwhich provides utilities of independent interest such as\nexpandable and non-expandable loops; xintfrac, which computes\nfractions using xint; xintexpr, which extends xintfrac with an\nexpandable parser of comma separated expressions involving\nintegers, fractions, boolean, and algebraic operators, and\ndeclared as well as dummy variables; xintbinhex provides\nconversions to and from binary and hexadecimal bases;\nxintseries, which provides basic functionality for computing\npartial sums using xint; xintgcd, which provides\nimplementations of the Euclidean algorithm, and of its\ntypesetting; xintcfrac, which deals with the computation of\ncontinued fractions. All of the packages' computations are done\nin a way that they can operate in an expanding environment. The\npackages may be used either with Plain TeX or LaTeX.\n",
