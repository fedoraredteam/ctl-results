            "Description": "\nThe dashrule package makes it easy to draw a huge variety of\ndashed rules (i.e., lines) in LaTeX. dashrule provides a\ncommand, \\hdashrule, which is a cross between LaTeX's \\rule and\nPostScript's setdash command. \\hdashrule draws horizontally\ndashed rules using the same syntax as \\rule, but with an\nadditional, setdash-like parameter that specifies the pattern\nof dash segments and the space between those segments. Because\ndashrule's rules are constructed internally using \\rule (as\nopposed to, e.g., PostScript \\specials) they are fully\ncompatible with every LaTeX back-end processor.\n",
