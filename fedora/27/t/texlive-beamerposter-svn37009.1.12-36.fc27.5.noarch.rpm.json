            "Description": "\nThe package enables the user to use beamer style operations on\na canvas of the sizes provided by a0poster; font scaling is\navailable (using packages such as type1cm if necessary). In\naddition, the package allows the user to benefit from the nice\ncolour box handling and alignment provided by the beamer class\n(for example, with rounded corners and shadows). Good looking\nposters may be created very rapidly. Features include: scalable\nfonts using the fp and type1cm packages; posters in A-series\nsizes, and custom sizes like double A0 are possible; still\napplicable to custom beamer slides, e.g. 16:9 slides for a wide-\nscreen (i.e. 1.78 aspect ratio); orientation may be portrait or\nlandscape; a 'debug mode' is provided.\n",
