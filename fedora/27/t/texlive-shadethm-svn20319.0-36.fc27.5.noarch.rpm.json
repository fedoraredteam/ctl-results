If you say\n\\newshadetheorem{theorem}{Theorem} in the preamble then your\nregular \\begin{theorem} .. \\end{theorem} will produce a theorem\nstatement in a shaded box. It supports all the options of\n\\newtheorem, including forms \\newshadetheorem{..}[..]{..} and\n\\newshadetheorem{..}{..}[..]. Environments declared using the\npackage require their body to remain on one page; the mdframed\npackage can frame and shade theorems, and its environments\nbreak at the end of a page; users are generally recommended,\ntherefore, to use mdframed.\n",
