            "Description": "\nPerlTeX is a combination Perl script (perltex.pl) and LaTeX2e\npackage (perltex.sty) that, together, give the user the ability\nto define LaTeX macros in terms of Perl code. Once defined, a\nPerl macro becomes indistinguishable from any other LaTeX\nmacro. PerlTeX thereby combines LaTeX's typesetting power with\nPerl's programmability. PerlTeX will make use of persistent\nnamed pipes, and thereby run more efficiently, on operating\nsystems that offer them (mostly Unix-like systems). Also\nprovided is a switch to generate a PerlTeX-free, document-\nspecific, noperltex.sty that is useful when distributing a\ndocument to places where PerlTeX is not available.\n",
