            "Description": "\nThe package gives the user complete control of how the entries\nof the table of contents should be constituted from the name,\nnumber, and page number of each sectioning unit. The layout is\ncontrolled by the definition of 'line styles' for each\nsectioning level used in the document. The package provides its\nown custom line styles (which may be used as examples), and\ncontinues to support the standard formatting inherited from the\nLaTeX document classes, but the package can also allow the user\nto delegate the details to packages dealing with list making\nenvironments (such as enumitem). The package's default global\nstyle typesets tables of contents in a multi-column format,\nwith either a standard heading, or a ruled title (optionally\nwith a frame around the table). The \\tableofcontents command\nmay be used arbitrarily many times in the same document, while\n\\localtableofcontents provides a 'local' table of contents.\n",
