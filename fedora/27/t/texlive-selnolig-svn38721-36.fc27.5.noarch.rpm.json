            "Description": "\nThe package suppresses typographic ligatures selectively, i.e.,\nbased on predefined search patterns. The search patterns focus\non ligatures deemed inappropriate because they span morpheme\nboundaries. For example, the word shelfful, which is mentioned\nin the TeXbook as a word for which the ff ligature might be\ninappropriate, is automatically typeset as shelf\\/ful rather\nthan as shel{ff}ul. For English and German language documents,\nthe package provides extensive rules for the selective\nsuppression of so-called \"common\" ligatures. These comprise the\nff, fi, fl, ffi, and ffl ligatures as well as the ft and fft\nligatures. Other f-ligatures, such as fb, fh, fj and fk, are\nsuppressed globally, while exceptions are made for names and\nwords of non-English/German origin, such as Kafka and fjord.\nFor English language documents, the package further provides\nligature suppression macros for a number of so-called\n\"discretionary\" or \"rare\" ligatures such as ct, st, and sp. The\npackage requires use of a recent LuaLaTeX format (for example\nthose from TeX Live 2012 or 2013, or MiKTeX 2.9).\n",
