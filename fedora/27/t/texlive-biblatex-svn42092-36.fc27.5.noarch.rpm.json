            "Description": "\nBiblatex is a complete reimplementation of the bibliographic\nfacilities provided by LaTeX in conjunction with BibTeX. It\nredesigns the way in which LaTeX interacts with BibTeX at a\nfairly fundamental level. With biblatex, BibTeX is only used\n(if it is used at all) to sort the bibliography and to generate\nlabels. Formatting of the bibliography is entirely controlled\nby TeX macros (the BibTeX-based mechanism embeds some parts of\nformatting in the BibTeX style file. Good working knowledge in\nLaTeX should be sufficient to design new bibliography and\ncitation styles; nothing related to BibTeX's language is\nneeded. In fact, users need not remain bound to BibTeX for use\nwith biblatex: an alternative bibliography processor biblatex-\nbiber is available. Development of biblatex and biblatex-biber\nis closely coupled; the present release of biblatex is designed\nto work with biblatex-biber version 0.9.6. The package needs e-\nTeX, and uses the author's etoolbox and logreq packages. For\nusers of biblatex-biber, version 0.9 is required (at least;\nrefer to the notes for the version of biblatex-biber that you\nare using). Apart from the features unique to biblatex, the\npackage also incorporates core features of the following\npackages: babelbib, bibtopic, bibunits, chapterbib, cite,\ninlinebib, mcite and mciteplus, mlbib, multibib, splitbib.\nBiblatex supports split bibliographies and multiple\nbibliographies within one document, and separate lists of\nbibliographic shorthands. Bibliographies may be subdivided into\nparts (by chapter, by section, etc.) and/or segmented by topics\n(by type, by keyword, etc.). Biblatex is fully localized and\ncan interface with the babel.\n",
