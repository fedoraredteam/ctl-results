The family is comprehensive,\noffering both sans and roman styles, and a monospaced font,\ntogether with mathematics fonts closely integrated with the\nmathematical facilities of TeX itself. The base fonts are\ndistributed as Metafont source, but autotraced PostScript Type\n1 versions are available (one version in the AMS fonts\ndistribution, and also the BaKoMa distribution). The Computer\nModern fonts have inspired many later families, notably the\nEuropean Computer Modern and the Latin Modern families.\n",
