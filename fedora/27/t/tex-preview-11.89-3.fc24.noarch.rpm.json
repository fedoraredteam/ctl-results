            "Description": "\nThe preview package for LaTeX allows for the processing of selected\nparts of a LaTeX input file.  This package extracts indicated pieces\nfrom a source file (typically displayed equations, figures and\ngraphics) and typesets with their base point at the (1in,1in) magic\nlocation, shipping out the individual pieces on separate pages without\nany page markup.  You can produce either DVI or PDF files, and options\nexist that will set the page size separately for each page.  In that\nmanner, further processing (as with Ghostscript or dvipng) will be\nable to work in a single pass.\n\nThe main purpose of this package is the extraction of certain\nenvironments (most notably displayed formulas) from LaTeX sources as\ngraphics. This works with DVI files postprocessed by either Dvips and\nGhostscript or dvipng, but it also works when you are using PDFTeX for\ngenerating PDF files (usually also postprocessed by Ghostscript).\n\nThe tex-preview package is generated from the AUCTeX package for\nEmacs.\n",
