It is convenient to use this package when your\nsubfigures are to be separately captioned, referenced, or are\nto be included in the List-of-Figures. A new \\subfigure command\nis introduced which can be used inside a figure environment for\neach subfigure. An optional first argument is used as the\ncaption for that subfigure. The package is now considered\nobsolete: it was superseded by subfig, but users may find the\nmore recent subcaption package more satisfactory.\n",
