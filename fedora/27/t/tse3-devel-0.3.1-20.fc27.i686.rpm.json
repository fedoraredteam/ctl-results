It is a\n'sequencer engine' because it provides the actual driving force elements of a\nsequencer but provides no form of user interface. Sequencer applications or\nmultimedia presentation packages will incorporate the TSE3 libraries to\nprovide a user with MIDI sequencing facilities.\n\nThis package holds the development documentation, examples and header files\nfor TSE3.\n",
