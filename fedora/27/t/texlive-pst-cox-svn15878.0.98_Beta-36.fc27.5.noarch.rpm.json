            "Description": "\nPst-cox is a PSTricks package for drawing 2-dimensional\nprojections of complex regular polytopes (after the work of\nCoxeter). The package consists of a macro library for drawing\nthe projections. The complex polytopes appear in the study of\nthe root systems and play a crucial role in many domains\nrelated to mathematics and physics. These polytopes have been\ncompletely described by Coxeter in his book \"Regular Complex\nPolytopes\". There exist only a finite numbers of exceptional\nregular complex polytopes (for example the icosahedron) and\nsome infinite series (for example, one can construct a multi-\ndimensional analogue of the hypercube in any finite dimension).\nThe library contains two packages. The first, pst-coxcoor, is\ndevoted to the exceptional complex regular polytopes whose\ncoordinates have been pre-computed. The second, pst-coxeterp,\nis devoted to the infinite series.\n",
