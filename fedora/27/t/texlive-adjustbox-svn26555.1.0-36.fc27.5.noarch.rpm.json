            "Description": "\nThe package provides several macros to adjust boxed content.\nOne purpose is to supplement the standard graphics package,\nwhich defines the macros \\resizebox, \\scalebox and \\rotatebox ,\nwith the macros\\trimbox and \\clipbox. The main feature is the\ngeneral \\adjustbox macro which extends the \"key=value\"\ninterface of \\includegraphics from the graphics package and\napplies it to general text content. Additional provided box\nmacros are \\lapbox, \\marginbox, \\minsizebox, \\maxsizebox and\n\\phantombox. All macros use the collectbox package to read the\ncontent as a box and not as a macro argument. This allows for\nall forms of content including special material like verbatim\ncontent. A special feature of collectbox is used to provide\nmatching environments with the identical names as the macros.\n",
