            "Description": "\nThe package provides solutions to a number of common\ndifficulties in writing displayed equations and getting high-\nquality output. For example, it is a well-known inconvenience\nthat if an equation must be broken into more than one line,\n'left...right' constructs cannot span lines. The breqn package\nmakes them work as one would expect whether or not there is an\nintervening line break. The single most ambitious goal of the\npackage, however, is to support automatic linebreaking of\ndisplayed equations. Such linebreaking cannot be done without\nsubstantial changes under the hood in the way formulae are\nprocessed; the code must be watched carefully, keeping an eye\non possible glitches. The bundle also contains the flexisym and\nmathstyle packages, which are both designated as support for\nbreqn.\n",
