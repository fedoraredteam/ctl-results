            "Description": "\nEmp is a package for encapsulating MetaPost figures in LaTeX:\nthe package provides environments where you can place MetaPost\ncommands, and means of using that code as fragments for\nbuilding up figures to include in your document. So, with emp,\nthe procedure is to run your document with LaTeX, run MetaPost,\nand then complete running your document in the normal way. Emp\nis therefore useful for keeping illustrations in synchrony with\nthe text. It also frees you from inventing descriptive names\nfor PostScript files that fit into the confines of file system\nconventions.\n",
