The script consists of\nminuscules and digits, with some appropriate period punctuation\nmarks. Both normal and bold versions are provided, and the font\nis distributed in Adobe Type 1 format. This is an experimental\nnew version of the auncial bundle, which is one of a series of\nbookhand fonts. The font follows the B1 encoding developed for\nbookhands. Access to the encoding is essential. The encoding\nmainly follows the standard T1 encoding.\n",
