The Euler,\nRunge-Kutta and 4th order Runge-Kutta algorithms are available\nto solve the ODEs. The picture is translated into mfpic macros\nand MetaPost is used to create the final drawing. The package\nis was designed for use with LaTeX, but it can be used in plain\nTeX as well. Online demonstration of the mfpic4ode macros is\navailable on the Mfpic Previewer as Example 6.\n",
