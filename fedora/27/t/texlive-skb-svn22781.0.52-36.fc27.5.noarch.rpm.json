            "Description": "\nThe package provides macros that help to build a document\nrepository for long living documents. It focuses on structure\nand re-use of text, code, figures etc. The basic concept is\nfirst to separate structure from content (i.e., text about a\ntopic from the structure it is presented by) and then\nseparating the content from the actual published document, thus\nenabling easy re-use of text blocks in different publications\n(i.e., text about a protocol in a short article about this\nprotocol as well as in a book about many protocols); all\nwithout constantly copying or changing text. As a side effect,\nusing the document classes provided, it hides a lot of LaTeX\nfrom someone who just wants to write articles and books.\n",
