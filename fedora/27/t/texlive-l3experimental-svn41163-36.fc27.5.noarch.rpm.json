            "Description": "\nThe l3experimental packages are a collection of experimental\nimplementations for aspects of the LaTeX3 kernel, dealing with\nhigher-level ideas such as the Designer Interface. Some of them\nwork as stand alone packages, providing new functionality, and\ncan be used on top of LaTeX2e with no changes to the existing\nkernel. The present release includes: xgalley, which controls\nboxes receiving text for typesetting. l3regex: kernel support\nfor regular expression search and replace operations; l3sort:\nkernel support for sorting sequences, token lists or comma-\nlists, according to user-specified comparison criteria; l3str:\nkernel support for string manipulation; l3tl-build: kernel\nsupport for token list building; l3tl_analysis: kernel support\nfor token list analysis; and xcoffins, which allows the\nalignment of boxes using a series of 'handle' positions,\nsupplementing the simple TeX reference point. All the files of\nthe bundle are also available in the Subversion (SVN)\nrepository of the LaTeX3 Project. The bundle on CTAN is based\non a snapshot of the SVN repository on 2015-09-11.\n",
