It provides macros\nfor plotting and manipulating various mathematical functions:\npolynomials and their derivatives f(x)=an*x^n+an-1*x^(n-\n1)+...+a0 defined by the coefficients a0 a1 a2 ... and the\nderivative order; the Fourier sum f(x) = a0/2+a1cos(omega\nx)+...+b1sin(omega x)+... defined by the coefficients a0 a1 a2\n... b1 b2 b3 ...; the Bessel function defined by its order; the\nGauss function defined by sigma and mu; Bezier curves from\norder 1 (two control points) to order 9 (10 control points);\nthe superellipse function (the Lame curve); Chebyshev\npolynomials of the first and second kind; the Thomae (or\npopcorn) function; the Weierstrass function; various\nintegration-derived functions; normal, binomial, poisson,\ngamma, chi-squared, student's t, F, beta, Cauchy and Weibull\ndistribution functions and the Lorenz curve; the zeroes of a\nfunction, or the intermediate point of two functions; the\nVasicek function for describing the evolution of interest\nrates; and implicit functions. The plots may be generated as\nvolumes of rotation about the X-axis, as well.\n",
