The Kerkis font set has some support\nfor mathematics as well as other glyphs missing from the base\nURW Bookman fonts. Macros are provided to use the fonts in OT1,\nT1 (only NG/ng glyphs missing) and LGR encodings, as well as in\nmathematics; small caps and old-style number glyphs are also\navailable. The philosophy, and the design process, of the\nKerkis fonts is discussed in a paper in TUGboat 23(3/4), 2002.\n",
