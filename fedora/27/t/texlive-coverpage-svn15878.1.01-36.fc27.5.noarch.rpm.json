            "Description": "\nThe package CoverPage was created to supplement scientific\npapers with a cover page containing bibliographical\ninformation, a copyright notice, and/or some logos of the\nauthor's institution. The cover page is created (almost)\nautomatically; this is done by parsing BibTeX information\ncorresponding to the main document and reading a configuration\nfile in which the author can set information like the\naffiliation he or she is associated with. The cover page\nconsists of header, body and footer; all three are macros which\ncan be redefined using \\renewcommand, thus allowing easy\ncustomization of the package. Additionally, it should be\nstressed that the cover page layout is totally independent of\nthe main document and its page layout. This package requires\nfour other packages (keyval, url, textcomp, and verbatim), but\nall of them are standard packages and should be part of every\nLaTeX installation.\n",
