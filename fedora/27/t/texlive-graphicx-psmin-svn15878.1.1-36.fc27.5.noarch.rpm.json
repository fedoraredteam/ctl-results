            "Description": "\nThe package is an extension of the standard graphics bundle and\nprovides a way to include repeated PostScript graphics (ps,\neps) only once in a PostScript document. This leads to smaller\nPostScript documents when having, for instance, a logo on every\npage. The package only works when post-processed with dvips,\nwhich should eb version 5.95b or later. The difference for a\nresulting distilled PDF file is minimal (as Ghostscript and\nAdobe Distiller only include a single copy of each graphics\nfile, anyway).\n",
