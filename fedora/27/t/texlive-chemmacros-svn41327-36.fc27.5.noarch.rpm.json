Coverage includes some nomenclature commands,\noxidation numbers, thermodynamic data, newman projections, etc.\nThe package relies on the following supporting packages:\nchemformula, providing a command for typesetting chemical\nformulae and reactions (doing a similar task to that of\nmhchem); chemgreek, offering support for use of greek letters;\nand ghsystem, providing for the UN globally harmonised chemical\nnotation. The packages are written using current versions of\nthe experimental LaTeX 3 coding conventions and the LaTeX 3\nsupport packages.\n",
