The user can configure\ntheir own setup. The package offers a direct interface to\nvarioref (for use, for example, in large projects such as a\nseries of books, or a multivolume thesis written as a series of\ndocuments), and name references from the nameref package may be\nincorporated with ease. For large projects such as a series of\nbooks or a multi volume thesis, written as freestanding\ndocuments, a facility is provided to interface to the xr\npackage for external document references.\n",
