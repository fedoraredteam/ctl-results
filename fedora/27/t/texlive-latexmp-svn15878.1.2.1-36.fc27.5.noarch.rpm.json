The text to be typeset is given as string. This\nallows even dynamic text elements, for example counters, to be\nused in labels. Compared to other implementations it is much\nmore flexible, since it can be used as direct replacement for\nbtex..etex, and much faster, compared for example to the\nsolution provided by tex.mp\n",
