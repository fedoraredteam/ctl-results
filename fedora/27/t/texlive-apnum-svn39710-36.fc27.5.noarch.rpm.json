Operands may be numbers with arbitrary numbers of\ndigits; scientific notation is allowed. The expression scanner\nis also provided. Exhaustive documentation (including detailed\nTeXnical documentation) is included. The macro includes many\noptimizations and uses only TeX primitives (from classic TeX)\nand \\newcount macro.\n",
