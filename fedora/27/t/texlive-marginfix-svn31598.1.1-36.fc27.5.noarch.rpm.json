            "Description": "\nAuthors using LaTeX to typeset books with significant margin\nmaterial often run into the problem of long notes running off\nthe bottom of the page. A typical workaround is to insert\n\\vshift commands by hand, but this is a tedious process that is\ninvalidated when pagination changes. Another workaround is\nmemoir's \\sidebar function, but this can be unsatisfying for\nshort textual notes, and standard marginpars cannot be mixed\nwith sidebars. This package implements a solution to make\nmarginpars \"just work\" by keeping a list of floating inserts\nand arranging them intelligently in the output routine.\n",
