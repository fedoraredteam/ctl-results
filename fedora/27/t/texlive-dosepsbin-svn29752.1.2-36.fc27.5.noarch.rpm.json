This\nfile format, commonly known as DOS EPS format starts with a\nbinary header that contains the positions of the possible\nsections: Postscript (PS); Windows Metafile Format (WMF); and\nTag Image File Format (TIFF). The PS section must be present\nand either the WMF file or the TIFF file should be given. The\npackage provides a Perl program that will extract any of the\nsections of such a file, in particular providing a 'text'-form\nEPS file for use with (La)TeX.\n",
