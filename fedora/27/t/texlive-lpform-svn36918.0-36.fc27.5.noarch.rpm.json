With the\npackage, one can easily label equations, formulations can span\nmultiple pages and several elements of the layout (such as\nspacing, texts and equation tags) are also customizable.\nBesides linear programming formulations, this package can also\nbe used to display any series of aligned equations with easy\nlabeling/referencing and other customization options.\n",
