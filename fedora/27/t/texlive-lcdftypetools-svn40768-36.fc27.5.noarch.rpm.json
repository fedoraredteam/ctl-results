It correctly\nhandles subroutines and hints; Mmafm and mmpfb, which create\ninstances of multiple-master fonts (mmafm and mmpfb were\npreviously distributed in their own package, mminstance);\nOtfinfo, which reports information about OpenType fonts, such\nas the features they support and the contents of their 'size'\noptical size features; Otftotfm, which creates TeX font metrics\nand encodings that correspond to a PostScript-flavored OpenType\nfont. It will interpret glyph positionings, substitutions, and\nligatures as far as it is able. You can say which OpenType\nfeatures should be activated; T1dotlessj, creates a Type 1 font\nwhose only character is a dotless j matching the input font's\ndesign; T1lint, which checks a Type 1 font for correctness;\nT1reencode, which replaces a font's internal encoding with one\nyou specify; and T1testpage, which creates a PostScript proof\nfor a Type 1 font. It is preliminary software.\n",
