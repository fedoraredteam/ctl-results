Along with the basic package is an\noptional extension that adds computation of sin, cos, log,\nsqrt, exp, powers and angles. These are also exact when\ntheoretically possible and are otherwise accurate to at least 7\ndecimal places. In addition, the package provides a stack-based\nprograming environment.\n",
