            "Description": "\nThis package contains the optional music files for The Mana World (TMW).\nTMW is an innovative, free and open source MMORPG.\nBesides the official game server, this client can connect to multiple\ncommunity-grown servers, which provide varied environments and further\nchallenge. In TMW, the players solve quests, fight monsters, practice skills\nand study magic. Social activities include parties, trading and limited PvP in\ndesignated areas. While there are no limits to solo play, collaborative\nbehavior such as healing others, fighting together and banding up against\ntougher monsters are rewarded in the game. The Mana World graphics have been\ninspired by 2D pixel art at its prime of the late 1990s, when many RPG\nclassics, such as Secret of Mana for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System,\nwere released.\n",
