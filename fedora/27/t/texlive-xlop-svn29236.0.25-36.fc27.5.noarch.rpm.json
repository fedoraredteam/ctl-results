So for example, \\opadd{2}{3} can give either\n$2+3=5$ or something similar to: \\begin{tabular}{r} 2\\\\ +3\\\\\n\\hline 5\\end{tabular}. Furthermore, numbers may be very large,\ne.g 200 figures (with a very long compilation time). Many other\nfeatures allow to deal with numbers (tests, display, some high\nlevel operations, etc.)\n",
