Other fonts, and most programming\nlanguages, print ` as a grave accent and ' upright; ' is used\nboth to open and to close quoted strings. The package switches\nthe typewriter font to Computer Modern Typewriter in OT1\nencoding, and modifies the behaviour of verbatim, verbatim*,\n\\verb, and \\verb* to print in the \"` and ' way\". It does\nthisregardless of other fonts or encodings in use, so long as\nthe package is loaded after the other fonts were. The package\ndoes not affect \\tt, \\texttt, etc.\n",
