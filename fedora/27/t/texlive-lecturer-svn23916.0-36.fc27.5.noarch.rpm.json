            "Description": "\nThe package creates slides for on-screen presentations based on\nPDF features without manipulating TeX's typesetting process.\nThe presentation flow relies on PDF's abilities to display\ncontent step by step. Features include: Free positioning of\nanything anywhere in painted areas on the slide, as well as in\nthe main textblock; Numerous attributes to control the layout\nand the presentation flow, from TeX's primitive dimensions to\nthe visibility of steps; Feature inheritance from global to\nlocal settings, with intermediate types; Basic drawing\nfacilities to produce symbols, e.g., for list items or buttons;\nColours, transparency, shades, and pictures; Navigation with\nlinks, pop-up menus, and customizable bookmarks; Easy switch\nbetween presentation and handout; and PDF transitions. Besides\nthe traditional documentation, the distribution includes visual\ndocumentation and six demo presentations ranging from geometric\nabstraction to classic style to silly video game. Lecturer is\ndesigned to work with all formats, but presently fails with\nConTeXt MkIV (because of clashes in management of PDF objects,\nprobably), works only with pdfTeX and LuaTeX for the time\nbeing, and requires texapi and yax, both v.1.02.\n",
