In standard LaTeX there is no provision for this.\nTo solve this problem Stephen Gildea once wrote subeqn.sty for\nLaTeX 2.09; Donald Arsenau rewrote the macros and Johannes\nBraams made them available for LaTeX2e. Note that this package\nis not compatible with the package subeqnarray (written by\nJohannes Braams), but it can be used together with the LaTeX\nclass options leqno and fleqn.\n",
