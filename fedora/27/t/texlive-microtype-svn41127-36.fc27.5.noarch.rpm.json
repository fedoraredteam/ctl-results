            "Description": "\nThe package provides a LaTeX interface to the micro-typographic\nextensions that were introduced by pdfTeX and have since also\npropagated to XeTeX and LuaTeX: most prominently, character\nprotrusion and font expansion, furthermore the adjustment of\ninterword spacing and additional kerning, as well as\nhyphenatable letterspacing (tracking) and the possibility to\ndisable all or selected ligatures. These features may be\napplied to customisable sets of fonts, and all micro-\ntypographic aspects of the fonts can be configured in a\nstraight-forward and flexible way. Settings for various fonts\nare provided. Note that character protrusion requires pdfTeX,\nLuaTeX, or XeTeX. Font expansion works with pdfTeX or LuaTeX.\nThe package will by default enable protrusion and expansion if\nthey can safely be assumed to work. Disabling ligatures\nrequires pdfTeX or LuaTeX, while the adjustment of interword\nspacing and of kerning only works with pdfTeX. Letterspacing is\navailable with pdfTeX or LuaTeX. The alternative package\n`letterspace', which also works with plain TeX, provides the\nuser commands for letterspacing only, omitting support for all\nother extensions.\n",
