And it is released in\nthe hope that people will use it and spot errors, bugs,\nfeatures so to improve it. Practically, it provides all the\ncapabilities of the greek option of the babel package. The\npackage can be invoked with any of the following options:\nmonotonic (for typesetting modern monotonic Greek), polytonic\n(for typesetting modern polytonic Greek), and ancient (for\ntypesetting ancient texts). The default option is monotonic.\nThe command \\setlanguage{<lang>} to activate the hyphenation\npatterns of the language <lang> This, however, can be done only\nif the format file has not been built with the babel mechanism.\n",
