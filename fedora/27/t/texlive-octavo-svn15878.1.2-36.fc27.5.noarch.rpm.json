Its purpose is to typeset books following classical\ndesign and layout principles, with the express intention of\nencouraging the making of beautiful books by anyone with access\nto a good printer and with an inclination towards venerable\ncrafts, e.g., bookbinding. The octavo class differs from the\nbook class by implementing many of the proposals and insights\nof respected experts, especially Jan Tschichold and Hugh\nWilliamson. The documentation discusses methods to organise and\nprint out any text into signatures, which can then be gathered,\nfolded and sewn into a book.\n",
