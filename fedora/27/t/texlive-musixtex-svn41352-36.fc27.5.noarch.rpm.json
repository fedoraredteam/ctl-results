            "Description": "\nMusiXTeX provides a set of macros, based on the earlier\nMusicTeX, for typesetting music with TeX. To produce optimal\nspacing, MusixTeX is a three-pass system: etex, musixflx, and\netex again. (Musixflx is a lua script that is provided in the\nbundle.) The three-pass process, optionally followed by\nprocessing for printed output, is automated by the musixtex\nwrapper script. The package uses its own specialised fonts,\nwhich must be available on the system for musixtex to run. This\nversion of MusixTeX builds upon work by Andreas Egler, whose\nown version is no longer being developed. The MusiXTeX macros\nare universally acknowledged to be challenging to use directly:\nthe pmx preprocessor compiles a simpler input language to\nMusixTeX macros..\n",
