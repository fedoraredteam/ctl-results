It requires the fontspec package and either\nthe Xe(La)TeX or the Lua(La)TeX engine to load the included\nacademicons.ttf font. The \"Academicons\" font was designed by\nJames Walsh and released (see\nhttp://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/) under the SIL Open Font\nLicense. This package is inspired by and based on the\nfontawesome package. academicons.sty provides the generic\n\\aiicon command to access icons, which takes as a mandatory\nargument the name of the desired icon. It also provides\nindividual direct commands for each specific icon. The full\nlist of icons and their respective names and direct commands\ncan be found in the manual.\n",
