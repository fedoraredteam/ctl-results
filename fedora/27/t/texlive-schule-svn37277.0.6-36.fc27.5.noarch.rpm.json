At the\nmoment its main focus lies on documents for informatics as a\nschool subject. An extension for physics is currently in\nprogress. Extensions for other subjects are welcome. For the\ntime being, the whole package splits up into individual\npackages for informatics (including syntax diagrams, Nassi-\nShneiderman diagrams, sequence diagrams, object diagrams, and\nclass diagrams) as well as classes for written exams (tests,\nquizzes, teaching observations, information sheets, worksheets,\nand answer keys).\n",
