Creating references thus\ndepends entirely on the user's skill in TeX. The package works\nwith all formats that use plain TeX's basic syntactic sugar;\nthe distribution includes a third-party file for ConTeXt and a\nstyle file for LaTeX. As an example of use, an Author (Year)\nstyle is given in a separate file and explained in the\ndocumentation.\n",
