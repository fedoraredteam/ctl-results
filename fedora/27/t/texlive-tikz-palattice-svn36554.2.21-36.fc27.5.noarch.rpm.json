            "Description": "\nThis package allows for drawing a map of a particle accelerator\njust by giving a list of elements -- similar to lattice files\nfor simulation software. The package includes 12 common element\ntypes like dipoles, quadrupoles, cavities, or screens, as well\nas automatic labels with element names, a legend, a rule, and\nan environment to fade out parts of the accelerator. The\ncoordinate of any element can be saved and used for custom tikz\ndrawings or annotations. Thereby, lattices can be connected to\ndraw injection/extraction or even a complete accelerator\nfacility.\n",
