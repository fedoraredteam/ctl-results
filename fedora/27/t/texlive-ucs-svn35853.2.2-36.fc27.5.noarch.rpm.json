            "Description": "\nThe bundle provides the ucs package, and utf8x.def, together\nwith a large number of support files. The utf8x.def definition\nfile for use with inputenc covers a wider range of Unicode\ncharacters than does utf8.def in the LaTeX distribution. The\npackage provides facilities for efficient use of its large sets\nof Unicode characters. Glyph production may be controlled by\nvarious options, which permits use of non-ASCII characters when\ncoding mathematical formulae. Note that the bundle previously\nhad an alias \"unicode\"; that alias has now been withdrawn, and\nno package of that name now exists.\n",
