            "Description": "\nOrbitron is a geometric sans-serif typeface intended for display purposes. It\nfeatures four weights (light, medium, bold, and black), a stylistic\nalternative, small caps, and a ton of alternate glyphs. Orbitron was designed\nso that graphic designers in the future will have some alternative to typefaces\nlike Eurostile or Bank Gothic. If you\u2019ve ever seen a futuristic sci-fi movie,\nyou have may noticed that all other fonts have been lost or destroyed in the\napocalypse that led humans to flee earth. Only those very few geometric\ntypefaces have survived to be used on spaceship exteriors, spacestation\nsignage, monopolistic corporate branding, uniforms featuring aerodynamic\nshoulder pads, etc. Of course Orbitron could also be used on the posters for\nthe movies portraying this inevitable future.\n",
