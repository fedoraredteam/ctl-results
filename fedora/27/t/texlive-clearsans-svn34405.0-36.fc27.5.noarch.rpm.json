            "Description": "\nClear Sans was designed by Daniel Ratighan at Monotype under\nthe direction of the User Experience team at Intel's Open\nSource Technology Center. Clear Sans is available in three\nweights (regular, medium, and bold) with corresponding italics,\nplus light and thin upright (without italics). Clear Sans has\nminimized, unambiguous characters and slightly narrow\nproportions, making it ideal for UI design. Its strong,\nrecognizable forms avoid distracting ambiguity, making Clear\nSans comfortable for reading short UI labels and long passages\nin both screen and print. The fonts are available in both\nTrueType and Type 1 formats.\n",
