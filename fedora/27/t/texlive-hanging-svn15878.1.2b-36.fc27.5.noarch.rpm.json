The package also enables typesetting with hanging\npunctuation, by making punctuation characters active. This\nfacility is best suppressed (it can interfere with other\npackages) -- there are package options for suppressing each\nindividual punctuation character. 'Real' attempts at hanging\npunction should nowadays use the microtype package, which takes\nadvantage of the support offered in recent versions of pdfTeX.\n",
