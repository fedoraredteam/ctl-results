            "Description": "\nEpstopdf is a Perl script that converts an EPS file to an\n'encapsulated' PDF file (a single page file whose media box is\nthe same as the original EPS's bounding box). The resulting\nfile suitable for inclusion by PDFTeX as an image. The script\nis adapted to run both on Windows and on Unix-alike systems.\nThe script makes use of Ghostscript for the actual conversion\nto PDF. It assumes Ghostscript version 6.51 or later, and (by\ndefault) suppresses its automatic rotation of pages where most\nof the text is not horizontal. LaTeX users may make use of the\nepstopdf package, which will run the epstopdf script \"on the\nfly\", thus giving the illusion that PDFLaTeX is accepting EPS\ngraphic files.\n",
