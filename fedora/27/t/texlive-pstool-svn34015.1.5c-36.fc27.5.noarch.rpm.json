            "Description": "\nThe package works in the same sort of way as pst-pdf, but it\nalso processes the PostScript graphics with psfrag to add\nlabels within the graphic, before conversion. Thus the bundle\nreplaces two steps of an ordinary workflow. (Naturally, the\npackage requires that \\write 18 is enabled.) Pstool ensures\nthat each version of each graphic is compiled once only (the\ngraphic is (re-)compiled only if it has changed since the\nprevious compilation of the document). This drastically speeds\nup the running of the package in the typical case (though the\nfirst run of any document is inevitably just as slow as with\nany similar package).\n",
