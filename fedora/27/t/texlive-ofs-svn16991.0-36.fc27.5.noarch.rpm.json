            "Description": "\nOFS (Olsak's Font System) is a set of Plain TeX and LaTeX\nmacros for managing large font collections; it has been used by\nCzech/Slovak users for many years. Main features include:\nMapping from long names of fonts to the metric file name. The\nuser can specify only exact long names in documents. Support\nfor many font encodings. Printing of catalogues of fonts and\ntest samples of font families; the interactive macro \\showfonts\nshows all font families you have installed via OFS. The user\ninterface is the same for Plain TeX and for LaTeX, but the\nimplementation differs: the LaTeX variant of OFS uses NFSS, but\nthe Plain variant implements its own font management (which may\neven be better than NFSS) Support for math fonts including TX\nfonts.\n",
