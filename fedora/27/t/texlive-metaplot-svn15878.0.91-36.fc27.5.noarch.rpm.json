            "Description": "\nMetaPlot is a set of Metapost macros for manipulating pre-\ngenerated plots (and similar objects), and formatting them for\ninclusion in a Metapost figure. The intent is that the plots\ncan be generated by some outside program, in an abstract manner\nthat does not require making decisions about on-page sizing and\nlayout, and then they can be imported into MetaPlot and\narranged using the full capabilities of Metapost. Metaplot also\nincludes a very flexible set of macros for generating plot\naxes, which may be useful in other contexts as well. Presently,\nMetaPlot is in something of a pre-release beta state; it is\nquite functional, but the syntax of the commands is still\npotentially in flux.\n",
