            "Description": "\nThe tools comprise six packages: datatool.sty: databases may be\ncreated using LaTeX commands or by importing external files;\nthey may be sorted numerically or alphabetically; repetitive\noperations (such as mail merging) may be performed on each row\nof a database, subject to conditions to exclude particular\nrows; commands are provided to examine database elements, and\nto convert formats (for example, to convert a numeric element\nto a format compatible with the fp package; datapie.sty: a\ndatabase may be represented as a pie chart; flexible options\nallow colouring of the chart, and annotation hooks are\navailable; dataplot.sty: a database may be represented as a 2-\ndimensional scatter or line plot; flexible options control of\nthe plot's overall appearance, and of legends and other extra\ninformation; databar.sty: a database may be represented as a\nbar chart; overall appearance, colouring and annotation are\ncontrollable; datagidx.sty: provides a way of indexing or\ncreating glossaries/lists of acronyms that uses TeX to do the\nsorting and collating instead of using an external indexing\napplication, such as xindy or makeindex; databib.sty: a\nbibliography may be loaded into a datatool database, and\nmanipulated there before being printed (this permits a LaTeX-\nbased route to printing bibliographies in formats for which no\nBibTeX style is available); and person.sty: provides support\nfor displaying a person's name and pronoun in a document, thus\navoiding cumbersome use of \"he/she\", etc. The drawing packages\nmake use of PGF/TikZ for their output. The bundle supersedes\nand replaces the author's csvtools bundle.\n",
