            "Description": "\nPkfix is a useful utility for replacing resolution-dependent\nbitmapped fonts in a dvips-produced PostScript file with the\ncorresponding resolution-independent vector fonts.\nUnfortunately, pkfix needs to parse certain PostScript comments\nthat appear only in files produced by dvips versions later than\n5.58 (ca. 1996); it fails to work on PostScript files produced\nby older versions of dvips. Pkfix-helper is a program that\nattempts to insert newer-dvips comments into an older-dvips\nPostScript file, thereby making the file suitable for\nprocessing by pkfix. pkfix-helper can sometimes process\ndocuments fully autonomously but does require the user to\nverify and, if needed, correct its decisions.\n",
