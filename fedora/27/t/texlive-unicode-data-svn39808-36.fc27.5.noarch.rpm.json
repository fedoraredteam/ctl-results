It contains a set of text files provided by the\nUnicode Consortium which are currently all from Unicode 8.0.0,\nwith the exception of MathClass.txt which is not currently part\nof the Unicode Character Database. Accompanying these source\ndata are generic TeX loader files allowing this data to be used\nas part of TeX runs, in particular in building format files.\nCurrently there are two loader files: one for general character\nset up and one for initialising XeTeX character classes as has\nbeen carried out to date by unicode-letters.tex. The source\ndata are distributed in accordance with the license stipulated\nby the Unicode Consortium. The bundle as a whole is co-\nordinated by the LaTeX3 Project as a general resource for TeX\nusers.\n",
