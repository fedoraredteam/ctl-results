The\nfonts are the original basis of the set of T2* and X2 encodings\nthat are now used when LaTeX users need to write in Cyrillic\nlanguages. Macro support in standard LaTeX encodings is offered\nthrough the cyrillic and t2 bundles, and the package itself\noffers support for other (more traditional) encodings. The\nfonts, in the standard T2* and X2 encodings are available in\nAdobe Type 1 format, in the CM-Super family of fonts. The\npackage also offers its own LaTeX support for OT2 encoded\nfonts, CM bright shaped fonts and Concrete shaped fonts.\n",
