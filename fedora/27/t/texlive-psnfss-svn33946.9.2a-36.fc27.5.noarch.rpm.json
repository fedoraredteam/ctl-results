            "Description": "\nFont definition files, macros and font metrics for freely-\navailable Adobe Type 1 fonts. The font set consists of the\n'LaserWriter 35' set (originally 'freely available' because\nembedded in PostScript printers), and a variety of other free\nfonts, together with some additions. Note that while many of\nthe fonts are available in PostScript (and other) printers,\nmost publishers require fonts embedded in documents, which\nrequires that you have the fonts in your TeX system.\nFortunately, there are free versions of the fonts from URW\n(available in the URW base5 bundle). The base set of text fonts\ncovered by PSNFSS are: AvantGarde, Bookman, Courier, Helvetica,\nNew Century Schoolbook, Palatino, Symbol, Times Roman and Zapf\nDingbats. In addition, the fonts Bitstream Charter and Adobe\nUtopia are covered (those fonts were contributed to the Public\nDomain by their commercial foundries). Separate packages are\nprovided to load each font for use as main text font. The\npackages helvet (which allows Helvetica to be loaded with its\nsize scaled to something more nearly appropriate for its use as\na Sans-Serif font to match Times) and pifont (which provides\nthe means to select single glyphs from symbol fonts) are\ntailored to special requirements of their fonts. Mathematics\nare covered by the mathptmx package, which constructs passable\nmathematics from a combination of Times Roman, Symbol and some\nglyphs from Computer Modern, and by Pazo Math (optionally\nextended with the fpl small-caps and old-style figures fonts)\nwhich uses Palatino as base font, with the mathpazo fonts. The\nbundle as a whole is part of the LaTeX 'required' set of\npackages.\n",
