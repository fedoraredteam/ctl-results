Optionally, such a box may be\nsplit in an upper and a lower part; thus the package may be\nused for the setting of LaTeX examples where one part of the\nbox displays the source code and the other part shows the\noutput. Another common use case is the setting of theorems. The\npackage supports saving and reuse of source code and text\nparts.\n",
