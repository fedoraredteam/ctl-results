            "Description": "\nExamplep provides sophisticated features for typesetting\nverbatim source code listings, including the display of the\nsource code and its compiled LaTeX or Metapost output side-by-\nside, with automatic width detection and enabled page breaks\n(in the source), without the need for specifying the source\ntwice. Special care is taken that section, page and footnote\nnumbers do not interfere with the main document. For\ntypesetting short verbatim phrases, a replacement for the \\verb\ncommand is also provided in the package, which can be used\ninside tables and moving arguments such as footnotes and\nsection titles. The listings package is used for syntax\nhighlighting. The accompanying codep package and the wrfiles.pl\nPerl script provide a convenient interface to the examplep\npackage for authors of manuals. With codep it is possible to\ngenerate the source code, the LaTeX or METAPOST output and the\ncompilable example file from a single source embedded into the\nappropriate place of the .tex document file.\n",
