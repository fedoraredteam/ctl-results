            "Description": "\nThe EC fonts are European Computer Modern Fonts, supporting the\ncomplete LaTeX T1 encoding defined at the 1990 TUG conference\nhold at Cork/Ireland. These fonts are intended to be stable\nwith no changes being made to the tfm files. The set also\ncontains a Text Companion Symbol font, called tc, featuring\nmany useful characters needed in text typesetting, for example\noldstyle digits, currency symbols (including the newly created\nEuro symbol), the permille sign, copyright, trade mark and\nservicemark as well as a copyleft sign, and many others. Recent\nreleases of LaTeX2e support the EC fonts. The EC fonts\nsupersede the preliminary version released as the DC fonts. The\nfonts are available in (traced) Adobe Type 1 format, as part of\nthe cm-super bundle. The other Computer Modern-style T1-encoded\nType 1 set, Latin Modern, is not actually a direct development\nof the EC set, and differs from the EC in a number of\nparticulars.\n",
