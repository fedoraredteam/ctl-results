            "Description": "\nThe greektonoi mapping extends the betababel package or the\nbabel polutonikogreek option to provide a simple way to insert\nancient Greek texts with diacritical characters into your\ndocument using a similar method to the commonly used Beta Code\ntransliteration, but with much more freedom. It is designed\nespecially for the XeTeX engine and it could also be used for\nfast and easy modification of monotonic greek texts to\npolytonic. The output text is natively encoded in Unicode, so\nit can be reused in any possible way. The greektonoi package\nprovides, in addition to inserting greek accents and\nbreathings, many other symbols used in greek numbers and\narithmetic or in the greek archaic period. It could be used\nwith greektonoi mapping or indepedently.\n",
