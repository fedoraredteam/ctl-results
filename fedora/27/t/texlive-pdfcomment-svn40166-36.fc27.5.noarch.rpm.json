However, the command is\npresented in a form where additional knowledge of the\ndefinition of the PDF format is indispensable. This package is\nan answer to the - occasional - questions in newsgroups, about\nhow one could use the comment function of Adobe Reader. At\nleast for the writer of LaTeX code, the package offers a\nconvenient and user-friendly means of using \\pdfannot to\nprovide comments in PDF files. Since version v1.1,\npdfcomment.sty also supports LaTeX - dvips - ps2pdf, LaTeX -\ndvipdfmx, and XeLaTeX. Unfortunately, support of PDF\nannotations by PDF viewers is sparse to nonexistent. The\nreference viewer for the development of this package is Adobe\nReader.\n",
