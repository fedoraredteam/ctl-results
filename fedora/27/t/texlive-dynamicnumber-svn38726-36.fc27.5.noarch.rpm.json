The aim is to reduce errors resulting from\nout-of-date numbers by directly setting them in the number\ngenerating file and importing a \"symbolic link\" into the LaTeX\nsource file. It can be used to import not only numerical\nvalues, but strings and pieces of code are also possible.\nCurrently only MATLAB and Python are supported to produce\nDynamic Number list files.\n",
