            "Description": "\nHaving lost the overview of my DVD archives, I simply could not\nremember if I already recorded the documentary running on TV\nthat day. I chose to recreate the index using LaTeX: the design\naim was a hyperlinked and fully searchable PDF-document,\nlisting my DVDs with all titles, lengths and so on. Further\nrequirements were support for seasons of tv series and a list\nwith all faulty or missing programs for rerecording. The\ndvdcoll class supports all these requirements. dvdcoll.cls\nfollows the structure <number><title><length>. As a result, the\nclass is not limited to DVDs--you can of course typeset\narchives of CD-ROMs, Audio-CDs and so on. Supported languages\nat the moment: English, French, German, Italian, Polish,\nPortuguese, Spanish. Some help is needed for other languages!\n",
