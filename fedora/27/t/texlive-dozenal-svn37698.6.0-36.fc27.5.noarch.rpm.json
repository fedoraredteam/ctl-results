            "Description": "\nThe package supports typesetting documents whose counters are\nrepresented in base twelve, also called \"dozenal\". It includes\na macro by David Kastrup for converting positive whole numbers\nto dozenal from decimal (base ten) representation. The package\nalso includes a few other macros and redefines all the standard\ncounters to produce dozenal output. Fonts, in Roman, italic,\nslanted, and boldface versions, provide ten and eleven (the\nPitman characters preferred by the Dozenal Society of Great\nBritain). The fonts were designed to blend well with the\nComputer Modern fonts, and are available both as Metafont\nsource and in Adobe Type 1 format.\n",
