            "Description": "\nTypesetting values with units requires care to ensure that the\ncombined mathematical meaning of the value plus unit\ncombination is clear. In particular, the SI units system lays\ndown a consistent set of units with rules on how they are to be\nused. However, different countries and publishers have\ndiffering conventions on the exact appearance of numbers (and\nunits). A number of LaTeX packages have been developed to\nprovide consistent application of the various rules: SIunits,\nsistyle, unitsdef and units are the leading examples. The\nnumprint package provides a large number of number-related\nfunctions, while dcolumn and rccol provide tools for\ntypesetting tabular numbers. The siunitx package takes the best\nfrom the existing packages, and adds new features and a\nconsistent interface. A number of new ideas have been\nincorporated, to fill gaps in the existing provision. The\npackage also provides backward-compatibility with SIunits,\nsistyle, unitsdef and units. The aim is to have one package to\nhandle all of the possible unit-related needs of LaTeX users.\nThe package relies on LaTeX 3 support from the l3kernel and\nl3packages bundles.\n",
