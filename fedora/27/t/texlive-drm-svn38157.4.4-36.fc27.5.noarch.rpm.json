It is\nintended to be a full-body text font, but its larger sizes can\nalso be used for simple display purposes, and its significant\nbody of symbols can stand on its own. It comes complete with\ntextual (\"old-style\") and lining figures, and even has small-\ncaps figures. It also comes with extensible decorative rules to\nbe used with ornaments from itself or other fonts, along with\nan extremely flexible ellipsis package.\n",
