The font was\nbrought to Greece at the time of the 1821 Greek Revolution, by\nDidot's son, and was very widely used. The present version is\nprovided by the Greek Font Society. The font supports the Greek\nalphabet, and is accompanied by a matching Latin alphabet based\non Zapf's Palatino. LaTeX support is provided, using the OT1,\nT1 and LGR encodings.\n",
