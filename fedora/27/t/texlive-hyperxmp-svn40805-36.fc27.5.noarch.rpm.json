            "Description": "\nXMP (eXtensible Metadata Platform) is a mechanism proposed by\nAdobe for embedding document metadata within the document\nitself. The metadata is designed to be easy to extract, even by\nprograms that are oblivious to the document's file format. Most\nof Adobe's applications store XMP metadata when saving files.\nNow, with the hyperxmp package, it is trivial for LaTeX\ndocument authors to store XMP metadata in their documents as\nwell. Version 2.2 of the package added support for the IPTC\nPhoto Metadata schema. It allows \\xmpcomma and \\xmpquote to be\nused in any hyperxmp option, not only those that require\nspecial treatment of commas. And it introduces an \\xmplinesep\nmacro that controls how multiline fields are represented in the\nXMP packet. The package integrates seamlessly with hyperref and\nrequires virtually no modifications to documents that already\nexploit hyperref's mechanisms for specifying PDF metadata. The\ncurrent version of hyperxmp can embed the following metadata as\nXMP: title, authors, primary author's title or position,\nmetadata writer, subject/summary, keywords, copyright, license\nURL, document base URL, document identifier and instance\nidentifier, language, source file name, PDF generating tool,\nPDF version, and contact telephone number/postal address/email\naddress/URL. Hyperxmp currently embeds XMP only within PDF\ndocuments; it is compatible with pdflatex, xelatex,\nlatex+dvipdfm, and latex+dvips+ps2pdf.\n",
