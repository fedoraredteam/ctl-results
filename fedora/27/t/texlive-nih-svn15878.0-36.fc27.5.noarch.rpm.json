The\nexample-* files provide a template for using nih.cls and\nsubmitting the biographical sketches the NIH wants. They\n(potentially) use denselists package, which just reduces list\nspacing; the package is distributed with the class, but is not\npart of the class proper. (The examples may be distributed\nwithout even the restrictions of the LaTeX licence.)\n",
