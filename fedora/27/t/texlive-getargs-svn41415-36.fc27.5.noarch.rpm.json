The name\nof the parsing macro is \\getargs. It is a significant\nimprovement over similarly named macros in the same author's\nstringstrings and readarray packages. It is the author's intent\nto eventually have the parsers of those other packages point to\nthis package, to achieve a measure of uniformity.\n",
