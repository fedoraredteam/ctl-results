The bi-directional capability\nsupposes that the user has a TeX engine that knows the four\nprimitives \\beginR, \\endR, \\beginL and \\endL. That is the case\nin both the TeX--XeT and e-TeX engines. Arabi will accept input\nin several 8-bit encodings, including UTF-8. Arabi can make use\nof a wide variety of Arabic and Farsi fonts, and provides one\nof its own. PDF files generated using Arabi may be searched,\nand text may be copied from them and pasted elsewhere.\n",
