There may not be displayed maths or\n'\\vadjust' material (no \\vspace) in the argument of \\shapepar.\nThe macros work for both LaTeX and plain TeX. For LaTeX,\nspecify \\usepackage{shapepar}; for Plain, \\input shapepar.sty.\n\\shapepar works in terms of user-defined shapes, though the\npackage does provide some predefined shapes: so you can form\nany paragraph into the form of a heart by putting\n\\heartpar{sometext...} inside your document. The tedium of\ncreating these polygon definitions may be alleviated by using\nthe shapepatch extension to transfig which will convert xfig\noutput to \\shapepar polygon form.\n",
