            "Description": "\nConTeXt has excellent pretty printing capabilities for many\nlanguages. The code for pretty printing is written in TeX, and\ndue to catcode juggling, such verbatim typesetting is perhaps\nthe trickiest part of TeX. This makes it difficult for a\n\"normal\" user to define syntax highlighting rules for a new\nlanguage. This module takes the onus of defining syntax\nhighlighting rules away from the user and uses ViM editor to\ngenerate the syntax highlighting. There is a helper\n2context.vim script to do the syntax parsing in ViM.\n",
