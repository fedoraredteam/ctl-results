The user will typically involve little more than\nis printed, and will still get LaTeX quality. The bundle\nprovides four packages: wiki addresses general texts, marked up\nin the simple style used on Wikipedia; niceverb is yet another\nmeans of documenting LaTeX packages: it offers syntax-aware\ntypesetting of meta-variables (macro arguments) and for\nreferring to commands (and their syntax) in footnotes, section\ntitles etc.; fifinddo aims to parse plain text or (La)TeX files\nusing TeX, and to write the results to an external file; the\npackage is used by another member of the bundle: makedoc, which\nprovides the means to produce typeset documentation direct from\npackage files.\n",
