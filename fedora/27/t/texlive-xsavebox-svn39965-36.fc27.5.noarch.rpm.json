            "Description": "\nThe package defines commands for saving content that can be\nrepeatedly placed into the document without replicating DVI/PDF\ncode in the output file, allowing for smaller file size of the\nfinal PDF and improved content caching for faster display in\ncertain PDF viewers. The method makes use of `Form XObjects'\ndefined in the PDF specification. The user commands are\nmodelled after the standard LaTeX commands \\savebox, \\sbox,\n\\usebox and the lrbox environment. All common TeX engines and\nback-ends are supported: pdfLaTeX, LuaLaTeX LaTeX --> dvips -->\nps2pdf/Distiller (Xe)LaTeX --> (x)dvipdfmx\n",
