            "Description": "\nQCM is a package for making multiple choices questionnaires\nunder LaTeX2e (\"QCM\" is the French acronym for this style of\ntest). A special environment allows you to define questions and\npossible answers. You can specify which answers are correct and\nwhich are not. QCM not only formats the questions for you, but\nalso generates a 'form' (a grid that your students will have to\nfill in), and a 'mask' (the same grid, only with correct\nanswers properly checked in). You can then print the mask on a\nslide and correct the questionnaires more easily by\nsuperimposing the mask on top of students' forms. QCM can also\ntypeset exam corrections automatically, and comes with support\nfor AUC-TeX.\n",
