Encodings\nsupported are OT1, T1, T2A, T2B, T2C and T5, together with LAE\n(Arabic), LFE (Farsi) and LGR (Greek) and a variant OT1tt for\ncmtt-like fonts. The package's main limitation currently is the\ninability to work with virtual fonts, because of limitations of\npdfTeX. This restriction may be resolved in a future version of\npdfTeX.\n",
