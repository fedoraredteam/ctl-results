Most common paper sizes,\npaper orientation, disabling of headers and footers, and two\nsided printing are supported. The vmargin package does not rely\non other packages and was designed with speed and size in mind.\nIts user interface might not be very fancy, but it's fast,\nsmall, and gets the job done. If you are looking for something\nmore elaborate try the geometry package.\n",
