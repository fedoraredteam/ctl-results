            "Description": "\nArabic-Latin Modern Fixed is an extension of TeX-Gyre Latin\nModern Mono 10 Regular. Every glyph and opentype feature of the\nLatin Modern Mono has been retained, with minor improvements.\nOn the other hand, we have changed the vertical metrics of the\nfont. Although the Arabic script is designed to use the same x-\nsize as Latin Modern Mono, the former script needs greater\nascender and descender space. Every Arabic glyph in each\nUnicode-code block is supported (up to Unicode 7.0): Arabic,\nArabic Supplement, Arabic Extended, Arabic Presentation-Forms\nA, and Arabic Presentation-Forms B. There are two versions of\nthe font: otf and ttf. The opentype version is for print\napplications (and usually the default for TeX). The TrueType\nversion is for on-screen applications such as text editors.\nHinting in the ttf version is much better for on-screen, at\nleast on Microsoft Windows. The unique feature of Arabic-Latin\nModern is its treatment of vowels and diacritics. Each vowel\nand diacritic (ALM Fixed contains a total of 68 such glyphs)\nmay now be edited horizontally within any text editor or\nprocessor. The author believes this is the very first opentype\nArabic font ever to have this capability. Editing complex\nArabic texts will now be much easier to input and to proofread.\n",
