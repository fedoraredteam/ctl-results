It is a response to comments on an answer at\nTeX Stack Exchange (http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/236410/)\nrequesting sample package files for others to copy. I had\npreviously assumed these were too trivial to be of interest,\nbut if they would be useful, then I would prefer them to be\ngenerally available via CTAN.\n",
