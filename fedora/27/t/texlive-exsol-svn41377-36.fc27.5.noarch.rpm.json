The\nexercise data are generated when running LaTeX on your\ndocument; the first run also writes the solutions to a\nsecondary file that may be included in a simple document\nharness, may be processed by LaTeX, to generate a nice solution\nbook. The code of the package was derived (in large part) from\nfancyvrb.\n",
