            "Description": "\nThe package enables the user to draw (using PSTricks) the\ndiffraction patterns for different geometric forms of apertures\nfor monochromatic light (using PSTricks). The aperture stops\ncan have rectangular, circular or triangular openings. The view\nof the diffraction may be planar, or three-dimensional. Options\navailable are the dimensions of the aperture under\nconsideration and of the particular optical setting, e.g. the\nradius in case of an circular opening. Moreover one can choose\nthe wavelength of the light (the associated color will be\ncalculated by the package).\n",
