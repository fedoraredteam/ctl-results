Maeda model.\nAnimation may be achieved by providing a sequence of vectors\nover time (e.g., from Matlab). A sequence of vectors for\ncertain German phonemes is embedded in the package, which\nallows for animation when no other vector is available. The\npackage's graphics are produced using pstricks.\n",
