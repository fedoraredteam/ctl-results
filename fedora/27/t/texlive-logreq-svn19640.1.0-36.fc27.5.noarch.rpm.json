            "Description": "\nThe package helps to automate a typical LaTeX workflow that\ninvolves running LaTeX several times, running tools such as\nBibTeX or makeindex, and so on. It will log requests like\n\"please rerun LaTeX\" or \"please run BibTeX on file X\" to an\nexternal XML file which lists all open tasks in a machine-\nreadable format. Compiler scripts and integrated LaTeX editing\nenvironments may parse this file to determine the next steps in\nthe workflow in a way that is more efficient than parsing the\nmain log file. In sum, the package will do two things: enable\npackage authors to use LaTeX commands to issue requests,\ncollect all requests from all packages and write them to an\nexternal XML file at the end of the document.\n",
