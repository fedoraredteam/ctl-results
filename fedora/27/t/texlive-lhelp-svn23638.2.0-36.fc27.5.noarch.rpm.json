It is a large collection of simple 'little helpers'\nwhich do not really warrant a separate package on their own.\nIncluded are, among other things, definitions of common units\nwith preceeding thinspaces, framed boxes where both width and\nheight can be specified, starting new odd or even pages, draft\nmarkers, notes, conditional includes, including EPS files, and\nversions of enumerate and itemize which allow the horizontal\nand vertical spacing to be changed.\n",
