            "Description": "\nThe package provides classicists with some of the tools that\nare needed for typesetting scholarly publications dealing with\nGreek and Latin texts, with special emphasis on Greek verse. As\nthe package's name suggests, its core is a comprehensive set of\ncommands for generating metrical schemes and for placing\nprosodical marks on text set in the Latin or the Greek\nalphabet. The rest of the package provides a miscellany of\ncommands for symbols (most of them not directly related to\nmetre) that are often used in critical editions of classical\ntexts. The package does not require any special font: all\nsymbols are taken from the Computer Modern fonts (which are\nincluded in all TeX distributions) and the package's commands\nare based on TeX primitives.\n",
