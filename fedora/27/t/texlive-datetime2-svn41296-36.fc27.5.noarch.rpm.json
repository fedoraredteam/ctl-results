In addition to \\today, you can also use \\DTMcurrenttime\n(current time) or \\DTMnow (current date and time). Dates and\ntimes can be saved for later use. The accompanying datetime2-\ncalc package can be used to convert date-times to UTC+00:00.\nLanguage and regional support is provided by independently\nmaintained and installed modules. The datetime2-calc package\nuses the pgfcalendar package (part of the PGF/TikZ bundle).\nThis package replaces datetime.sty which is now obsolete.\n",
