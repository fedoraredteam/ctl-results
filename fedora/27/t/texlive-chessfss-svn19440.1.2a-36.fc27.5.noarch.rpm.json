The\npackage doesn't parse, format and print PGN input like e.g. the\npackages skak or texmate; the aim of the package is to offer\nwriters of chess packages a bundle of commands for fonts, so\nthat they don't have to implement all these commands for\nthemselves. A normal user can use the package to print e.g.\nsingle chess symbols and simple diagrams. The documentation\ncontains also a section about installation of chess fonts.\n",
