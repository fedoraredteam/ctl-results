            "Description": "\nThis small library provides a standard set of environments for\nwriting minimization problems. It automatically aligns the\nproblems in three points with an optional fourth: Beginning of\nthe words \"minimize/argmin\" and \"subject to\" The objective\nfunction and the longest left hand side of the constraints The\n$= | > | <$ signs of the constraints. Optionally, the user can\nadd manually a double align character && to align some common\nconstraints feature. A clear example could be the constraints\nnames, e.g. (boundary constraint) alignment with (dynamic\nconstraint). Furthermore, it provides an easy interface to\ndefine optimization problem for three different reference\nsituations: Where no equation is referenced/numbered. Where the\nproblem is referenced with a single number. Where each equation\nhas an individual reference. Finally, it also allows a\ndefinition of any optimization problem without a limitless\nnumber of constraints.\n",
