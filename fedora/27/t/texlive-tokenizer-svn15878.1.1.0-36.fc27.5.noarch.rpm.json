The first token is saved in a newly created command with\nthe name passed as <Target1> and the second token likewise. A\npackage option 'trim' causes leading and trailing space to be\nremoved from each token; with this option, the \\TrimSpaces\ncommand is defined, which removes leading and trailing spaces\nfrom its argument.\n",
