            "Description": "\nAround 2008, researcher Byron Cook and several colleagues began\ndeveloping a new set of interrelated algorithms capable of\nautomatically reasoning about the behavior of computer programs\nand other systems (such as biological systems, circuit designs,\netc). At the center of these algorithms were new ideas about\nthe relationships between structures expressable as\nmathematical sets and relations. Using the language of\nmathematics and logic, the researchers communicated these new\nresults to others in their community via published papers,\nresearch talks, etc. Unfortunately, they found the symbols\nalready available for reasoning about relations lacking (in\ncontrast to sets, which have a long-ago developed and robust\nsymbol vocabulary). Early presentations were unnecessarily\ncluttered. To more elegantly express these ideas around\nrelations, Cook recruited artist Tauba Auerbach to help develop\na set of symbols. This package provides an math symbol font for\ndescribing relations between ordered pairs by using Metafont.\n",
