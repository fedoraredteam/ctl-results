            "Description": "\nThe package allows you to enter Python code within a LaTeX\ndocument, execute the code, and access its output in the\noriginal document. Python code is only executed when it has\nbeen modified, or when it meets user-specified criteria. Code\nmay be divided into user-defined sessions, which automatically\nrun in parallel. Errors and warnings are synchronized with the\nLaTeX document, so that they refer to the document's line\nnumbers. External dependencies can be tracked, so that code is\nre-executed when the data it depends on is modified. PythonTeX\nalso provides syntax highlighting for code in LaTeX documents\nvia the Pygments syntax highlighter. The package provides a\ndepythontex utility, that creates a copy of the document in\nwhich all Python code has been replaced by its output. This is\nuseful for journal submissions, sharing documents, and\nconversion to other formats.\n",
