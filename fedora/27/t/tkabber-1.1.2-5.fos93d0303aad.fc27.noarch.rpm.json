            "Description": "\nTkabber is a Free and Open Source client for the Jabber\ninstant messaging system. It's written in Tcl/Tk, and\nworks on many platforms. The choice of Tcl/Tk for a Jabber\nclient is three-fold:\n* it is portable: once you install a Tcl/Tk interpreter on\n  your system, the Tkabber script \"just runs\" \u2014 without having\n  to compile anything;\n* it is customizable: Tkabber reads a configuration file when\n  it starts that tells it the settings of various parameters; and,\n* it is extensible: the configuration file is actually a Tcl\n  script, so you can replace or augment entire portions of Tkabber\n  (if you're so inclined).\n",
