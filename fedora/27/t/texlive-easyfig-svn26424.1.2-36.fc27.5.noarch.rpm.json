Caption and label are set using the caption and label\nkeys; the label fig:<image filename> is used if none is given.\nIf the here key is given, the figure is not 'floated', and the\nuser is responsible for placement. The package uses the\nauthor's package adjustbox to centre an image and to simplify\nfurther modifications.\n",
