            "Description": "\nChemstyle has been developed as a successor to the LaTeX\npackage provided by the rsc bundle. The package provides an\nextensible system for formatting chemistry documents according\nto the conventions of a number of leading journals. It also\nprovides some handy chemistry-related macros. Chemstyle is much\nenhanced compared to its predecessor, and users of rsc are\nstrongly encouraged to migrate (all of the additional macros in\nthe rsc LaTeX package are present in chemstyle). The package\nchemscheme is distributed with chemstyle; chemstyle itself\nincorporates ideas that come from the trivfloat package; the\ndocumentation uses the auto-pst-pdf package.\n",
