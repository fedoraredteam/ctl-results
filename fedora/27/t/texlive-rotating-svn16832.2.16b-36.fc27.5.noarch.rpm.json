            "Description": "\nA package built on the standard LaTeX graphics package to\nperform all the different sorts of rotation one might like,\nincluding complete figures and tables with their captions. If\nyou want continuous text (i.e., more than one page) set in\nlandscape mode, use the lscape package instead. The rotating\npackages only deals in rotated boxes (or floats, which are\nthemselves boxes), and boxes always stay on one page. If you\nneed to use the facilities of the float in the same document,\nload rotating.sty via rotfloat, which smooths the path between\nthe rotating and float packages.\n",
