            "Description": "\nProduce Encapsulated PostScript Files (EPS/EPSF) from a one-\npage PostScript document, or any PostScript document. A correct\nBounding Box is calculated for the EPS files and some\nPostScript command sequences that can produce errorneous\nresults on printers are filtered. The input is cropped to\ninclude just the image contained in the PostScript file. The\nEPS files can then be included into TeX documents. Other\nprograms like ps2epsi (a script distributed with ghostscript)\ndon't always calculate the correct bounding box (because the\nvalues are put on the PostScript stack which may get corrupted\nby bad PostScript code) or they round it off, resulting in\nclipping the image. Therefore ps2eps uses a resolution of 144\ndpi to get the correct bounding box. The bundle includes\nbinaries for Linux, Solaris, Digital Unix or Windows\n2000/9x/NT; for other platforms, the user needs perl,\nghostscript and an ANSI-C compiler. Included in the\ndistribution is the bbox program, an application to produce\nBounding Box values for rawppm or rawpbm format files.\n",
