The class provides\nseveral features useful for designing tests or question sets:\nit allows for explicit markup of questions and answers; the\nclass will, at the user's request, automatically generate\nanswer keys; multiple versions of the same test can be\ngenerated automatically, with the ordering of questions within\neach section randomly permuted so as to minimize cheating; the\ngenerated answer keys can be constructed either with or without\nthe questions included; environments are provided to assist in\nconstructing the most common types of test question: matching,\ntrue/false, multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and short\nanswer/essay questions.\n",
