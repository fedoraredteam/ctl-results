The watchlist is provided\nunder [/projectname]/watchlist which is added to the main navigation bar as\nsoon the user watches something.\n\nThis plug-in is still under development. The basic functions are implemented\nbut the watchlist layout might change in the future. ATM there seems to be\nsome issues when PostgresSQL is used as DB backend. Therefore the DB table\nlayout might change in the future. Feel free to test it out and provide\nfeedback.\n",
