            "Description": "\nThe package arev provides type 1 and virtual fonts, together\nwith LaTeX packages for using Arev Sans in both text and\nmathematics. Arev Sans is a derivative of Bitstream Vera Sans\ncreated by Tavmjong Bah, adding support for Greek and Cyrillic\ncharacters. Bah also added a few variant letters that are more\nappropriate for mathematics. The primary purpose for using Arev\nSans in LaTeX is presentations, particularly when using a\ncomputer projector. In such a context, Arev Sans is quite\nreadable, with large x-height, \"open letters\", wide spacing,\nand thick stems. The style is very similar to the SliTeX font\nlcmss, but heavier. Arev is one of a very small number of sans-\nfont mathematics support packages. Others are cmbright, hvmath\nand kerkis.\n",
