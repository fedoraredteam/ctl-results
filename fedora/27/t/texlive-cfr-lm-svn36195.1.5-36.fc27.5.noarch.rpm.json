            "Description": "\nThe package supports a number of features of the Latin Modern\nfonts which are not easily accessible via the default (La)TeX\nsupport provided in the official distribution. In particular,\nthe package supports the use of the various styles of digits\navailable, small-caps and upright italic shapes, and\nalternative weights and widths. It also supports variable width\ntypewriter and the \"quotation\" font. Version 2.004 of the Latin\nModern fonts is supported. By default, the package uses\nproportional oldstyle digits and variable width typewriter but\nthis can be changed by passing appropriate options to the\npackage. The package also supports using (for example)\ndifferent styles of digits within a document so it is possible\nto use proportional oldstyle digits by default, say, but\ntabular lining digits within a particular table. The package\nrequires the official Latin Modern distribution, including its\n(La)TeX support. The package relies on the availability of both\nthe fonts themselves and the official font support files. The\npackage also makes use of the nfssext-cfr package. Only the T1\nand TS1 encodings are supported for text fonts. The set up of\nfonts for mathematics is identical to that provided by Latin\nModern.\n",
