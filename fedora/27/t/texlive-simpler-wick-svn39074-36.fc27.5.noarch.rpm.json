The contractions\nare denoted with a square bracket over the operators which are\nbeing contracted, which used to be rather annoying to typeset\nin LaTeX as the only other package available was simplewick,\nwhich is rather unwieldy. This package provides a simpler\nsyntax for Wick contractions.\n",
