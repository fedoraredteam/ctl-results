The user supplies axis labels, legend entries and the plot\ncoordinates for one or more plots and PGFPlots applies axis\nscaling, computes any logarithms and axis ticks and draws the\nplots, supporting line plots, scatter plots, piecewise constant\nplots, bar plots, area plots, mesh-- and surface plots and some\nmore. Pgfplots is based on PGF/TikZ (pgf); it runs equally for\nLaTeX/TeX/ConTeXt.\n",
