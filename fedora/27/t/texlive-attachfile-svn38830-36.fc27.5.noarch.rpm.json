            "Description": "\nStarting with PDF 1.3 (Adobe Acrobat 4.0), PDF files can\ncontain file attachments -- arbitrary files that a reader can\nextract, just like attachments to an e-mail message. The\nattachfile package brings this functionality to pdfLaTeX and\nprovides some additional features not available in Acrobat,\nsuch as the ability to use arbitrary LaTeX code for the file\nicon -- including things like \\includegraphics, tabular, and\nmathematics. Settings can be made either globally or on a per-\nattachment basis. Attachfile makes it easy to attach files and\ncustomize their appearance in the enclosing document. The\npackage supports the Created, Modified, and Size keys in the\nEmbeddedFile's Params dictionary.\n",
