            "Description": "\nPicTeX is an early, and very comprehensive drawing package,\nthat mostly draws by placing myriads of small dots to make up\npictures. It has a tendency to run out of space, most\nespecially of allowable dimensions registers; packages m-pictex\nand pictexwd deal with the register problem, in different ways.\nNote that full documentation may be bought via the PC-TeX site,\nthough a command summary is available as free software.\nAlternatively, a front-end package such as mathsPiC, which\ncovers all of PicTeX and has a complete and free manual, could\nbe used.\n",
