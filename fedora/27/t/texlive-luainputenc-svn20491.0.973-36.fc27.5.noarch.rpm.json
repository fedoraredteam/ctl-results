            "Description": "\nLuaTeX operates by default in UTF-8 input; thus LaTeX documents\nthat need 8-bit character-sets need special treatment. (In\nfact, LaTeX documents using UTF-8 with \"traditional\" -- 256-\nglyph -- fonts also need support from this package.) The\npackage, therefore, replaces the LaTeX standard inputenc for\nuse under LuaTeX. With a current LuaTeX,the package has the\nsame behaviour with LuaTeX as inputenc has under pdfTeX.\n",
