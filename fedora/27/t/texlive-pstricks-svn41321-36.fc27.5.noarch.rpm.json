            "Description": "\nPSTricks offers an extensive collection of macros for\ngenerating PostScript that is usable with most TeX macro\nformats, including Plain TeX, LaTeX, AMS-TeX, and AMS-LaTeX.\nIncluded are macros for colour, graphics, pie charts, rotation,\ntrees and overlays. It has many special features, including a\nwide variety of graphics (picture drawing) macros, with a\nflexible interface and with colour support. There are macros\nfor colouring or shading the cells of tables. The package\npstricks-add contains bug-fixes and additions for PSTricks\n(among other things). PSTricks ordinarily uses PostScript\n\\special commands, which are not supported by pdf(La)TeX. This\nlimitation may be overcome by using either the pst-pdf or the\npdftricks package, to generate a PDF inclusion from a PSTricks\ndiagram. PSTricks macros can also generate PDF output when the\ndocument is processed XeTeX, without the need for other\nsupporting packages. Note that this is one of a pair of\ncatalogue entries for PSTricks; the other one (PSTricks) is\nacting as a \"stub\", while editorial work on catalogue entries\nfor PSTricks contributed is completed.\n",
