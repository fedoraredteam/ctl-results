            "Description": "\nThe talk document class allows you to create slides for screen\npresentations or printing on transparencies. It also allows you\nto print personal notes for your talk. You can create overlays\nand display structure information (current section /\nsubsection, table of contents) on your slides. The main feature\nthat distinguishes talk from other presentation classes like\nbeamer or prosper is that it allows the user to define an\narbitrary number of slide styles and switch between these\nstyles from slide to slide. This way the slide layout can be\nadapted to the slide content. For example, the title or\ncontents page of a talk can be given a slightly different\nlayout than the other slides. The talk class makes no\nrestrictions on the slide design whatsoever. The entire look\nand feel of the presentation can be defined by the user. The\nstyle definitions should be put in a separate sty file.\nCurrently the package comes with only one set of pre-defined\nslide styles (greybars.sty). Contributions from people who are\nartistically more gifted than the author are more than welcome!\n",
