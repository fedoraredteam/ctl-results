            "Description": "\nPedigree and genealogical tree diagrams are proven tools to\nvisualize genetic and relational connections between\nindividuals. The naming (\"tree\") derives from historical family\ndiagrams. However, even the smallest family entity consisting\nof two parents and several children is hardly a 'mathematical'\ntree -- it is a more general graph. The package provides a set\nof tools to typeset genealogical trees (i.e., to typeset a set\nof special graphs for the description of family-like\nstructures). The package uses an autolayout algorithm which can\nbe customized, e.g., to prioritize certain paths.\n",
