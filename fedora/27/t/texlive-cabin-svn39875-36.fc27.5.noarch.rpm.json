According to the designer, Pablo Impallari,\nCabin was inspired by Edward Johnston's and Eric Gill's\ntypefaces, with a touch of modernism. Cabin incorporates modern\nproportions, optical adjustments, and some elements of the\ngeometric sans. cabin.sty supports use of the font under LaTeX,\npdfLaTeX, xeLaTeX and luaLaTeX; it uses the mweights, to manage\nthe user's view of all those font weights. An sfdefault option\nis provided to enable Cabin as the default text font. The\nfontaxes package is required for use with [pdf]LaTeX.\n",
