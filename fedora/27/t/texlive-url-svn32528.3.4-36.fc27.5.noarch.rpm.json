(The \\urldef command provides\nrobust commands that serve in cases when \\url doesn't work in\nan argument.) The command is intended for email addresses,\nhypertext links, directories/paths, etc., which normally have\nno spaces, so by default the package ignores spaces in its\nargument. However, a package option \"allows spaces\", which is\nuseful for operating systems where spaces are a common part of\nfile names.\n",
