            "Description": "\nAn extended grid-based puzzle package, designed to take all\ninput (both grid and clues) from the same file. The package can\ntypeset grids with holes in them (for advertisements, or other\nsorts of stuff), and can deal with several sorts of puzzle: The\nclassical puzzle contains numbers for the words and clues for\nthe words to be filled in. The numbered puzzle contains numbers\nin each cell where identical numbers represent identical\nletters. The goal is to find out which number corresponds to\nwhich letter. The fill-in type of puzzle consists of a grid and\na list of words. The goal is to place all words in the grid.\nSudoku and Kakuro puzzles involve filling in grids of numbers\naccording to their own rules. Format may be block-separated, or\nseparated by thick lines. Input to the package is somewhat\nredundant: specification of the grid is separate from\nspecification of the clues (if they're necessary). The author\nconsiders this style both 'natural' and robust.\n",
