It uses a\nrecent version (3.0+) of PGF and TikZ for the drawing, hence,\nit is mainly a set of TikZ styles that makes the drawing of\nbond graphs easier. Compared to the bondgraph package this\npackage relies more on TikZ styles and less on macros, to\ngenerate the drawings. As such it can be more flexible than\nhis, but requires more TikZ knowledge of the user.\n",
