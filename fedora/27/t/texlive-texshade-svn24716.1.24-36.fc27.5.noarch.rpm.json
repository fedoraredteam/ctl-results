In addition to common shading\nalgorithms, it provides special shading modes showing\nfunctional aspects, e.g. charge or hydropathy, and a wide range\nof commands for handling shading colours, text styles, labels,\nlegends; it even allows the user to define completely new\nshading modes. TeXshade combines highest flexibility with TeX\noutput quality -- all in a bundle that does not demand\nexcessive development time of the user.\n",
