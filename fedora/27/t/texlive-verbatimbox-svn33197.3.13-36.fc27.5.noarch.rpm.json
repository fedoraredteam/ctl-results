The global\nbox may then be used in a variety of situations (for example,\nproviding a replica of the boxedverbatim environment itself). A\nvaluable use is in places where the standard verbatim\nenvironment (which is based on a trivlist) may not appear. The\npackage makes use of the verbatim package (which is a required\npart of any LaTeX distribution).\n",
