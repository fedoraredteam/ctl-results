            "Description": "\nTycho is a set of Maven plugins and extensions for building Eclipse\nplugins and OSGI bundles with Maven. Eclipse plugins and OSGI bundles\nhave their own metadata for expressing dependencies, source folder\nlocations, etc. that are normally found in a Maven POM. Tycho uses\nnative metadata for Eclipse plugins and OSGi bundles and uses the POM\nto configure and drive the build. Tycho supports bundles, fragments,\nfeatures, update site projects and RCP applications. Tycho also knows\nhow to run JUnit test plugins using OSGi runtime and there is also\nsupport for sharing build results using Maven artifact repositories.\n\nTycho plugins introduce new packaging types and the corresponding\nlifecycle bindings that allow Maven to use OSGi and Eclipse metadata\nduring a Maven build. OSGi rules are used to resolve project\ndependencies and package visibility restrictions are honored by the\nOSGi-aware JDT-based compiler plugin. Tycho will use OSGi metadata and\nOSGi rules to calculate project dependencies dynamically and injects\nthem into the Maven project model at build time. Tycho supports all\nattributes supported by the Eclipse OSGi resolver (Require-Bundle,\nImport-Package, Eclipse-GenericRequire, etc). Tycho will use proper\nclasspath access rules during compilation. Tycho supports all project\ntypes supported by PDE and will use PDE/JDT project metadata where\npossible. One important design goal in Tycho is to make sure there is\nno duplication of metadata between POM and OSGi metadata.\n",
