            "Description": "\nThr purpose of the package is to provide an alternative\ninterface to the CM Sans Serif boldface fonts. The EC (T1,\nCork) encoded versions of the 'CM Sans Serif boldface extended'\nfonts differ considerably from the traditionally (OT1) encoded\nones: at large sizes, >10pt, they have thinner strokes and are\nmuch wider. At 25pt they are hardly to be recognized as being\n'boldface'. This package attempts to make these T1 fonts look\nlike the traditional ones did. You do not need any new fonts;\nthe package just changes the way LaTeX makes use of the current\nones.\n",
