            "Description": "\nWhile tools for the automated analysis of MS and LC-MS/ MS data are continuously improving,\nit is still often the case that at the end of an experiment,\nthe mass spectrometrists will spend time carefully examining individual spectra.\nCurrent software support is mostly provided only by the instrument vendors,\nand the available software tools are often instrument-dependent. Such software can only be used\nto analyze data from a specific instrument, and this causes serious problems\nfor laboratories that use more than one instrument.\nThis tight software-instrument relationship also causes problems for laboratories that\ndo not possess their own instruments, and have to obtain mass spectra from other,\ncollaborating, laboratories.\nTo provide a solution to these limitations I have started to develop mMass - open source\nmulti-platform tool for precise mass spectrometric data analysis and interpretation.\n",
