            "Description": "\nThe Apache FtpServer is a 100% pure Java FTP server. It's\ndesigned to be a complete and portable FTP server engine\nsolution based on currently available open protocols.\nFtpServer can be run standalone as a Windows service or\nUnix/Linux daemon, or embedded into a Java application.\nWe also provide support for integration within Spring\napplications and provide our releases as OSGi bundles.\n\nThe default network support is based on Apache MINA, a\nhigh performance asynchronous IO library. Using MINA,\nFtpServer can scale to a large number of concurrent users.\n\nIt is also an FTP application platform. We have developed\na Java API to let you write Java code to process FTP event\nnotifications that we call the Ftplet API. Apache FtpServer\nprovides an implementation of an FTP server to support this\nAPI.\n",
