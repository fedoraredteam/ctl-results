            "Description": "\nMPFI is intended to be a portable library written in C for arbitrary\nprecision interval arithmetic with intervals represented using MPFR\nreliable floating-point numbers. It is based on the GNU MP library and\non the MPFR library and is part of the latter. The purpose of an\narbitrary precision interval arithmetic is on the one hand to get\n\"guaranteed\" results, thanks to interval computation, and on the other\nhand to obtain accurate results, thanks to multiple precision\narithmetic. The MPFI library is built upon MPFR in order to benefit\nfrom the correct roundings provided by MPFR. Further advantages of\nusing MPFR are its portability and compliance with the IEEE 754\nstandard for floating-point arithmetic.\n",
