This interface\nis known more commonly as pthreads. A good number of modern operating\nsystems include a threading library of some kind: Solaris (UI)\nthreads, Win32 threads, DCE threads, DECthreads, or any of the draft\nrevisions of the pthreads standard. The trend is that most of these\nsystems are slowly adopting the pthreads standard API, with\napplication developers following suit to reduce porting woes.\n\nWin32 does not, and is unlikely to ever, support pthreads\nnatively. This project seeks to provide a freely available and\nhigh-quality solution to this problem.\n",
