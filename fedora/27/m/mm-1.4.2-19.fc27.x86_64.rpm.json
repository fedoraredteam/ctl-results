            "Description": "\nOSSP mm is a 2-layer abstraction library which simplifies the usage of\nshared memory between forked (and this way strongly related) processes\nunder Unix platforms. On the first layer it hides all platform dependent\nimplementation details (allocation and locking) when dealing with shared\nmemory segments and on the second layer it provides a high-level\nmalloc(3)-style API for a convenient and well known way to work with\ndata structures inside those shared memory segments.\n",
