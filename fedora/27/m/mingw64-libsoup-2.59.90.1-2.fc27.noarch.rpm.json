It was originally part\nof a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) implementation called Soup, but\nthe SOAP and non-SOAP parts have now been split into separate packages.\n\nlibsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK\napplications. This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers\non the network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to\nthe Gtk+ programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also\nsupported for those who want it).\n\nThis is the MinGW build of Libsoup\n",
