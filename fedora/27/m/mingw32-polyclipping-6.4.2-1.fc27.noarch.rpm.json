            "Description": "\nThis package contains the MinGW win32 port of the clipper polygon\nclipping library.\n\nThis library primarily performs the boolean clipping operations -\nintersection, union, difference & xor - on 2D polygons. It also performs\npolygon offsetting. The library handles complex (self-intersecting) polygons,\npolygons with holes and polygons with overlapping co-linear edges.\nInput polygons for clipping can use EvenOdd, NonZero, Positive and Negative\nfilling modes. The clipping code is based on the Vatti clipping algorithm,\nand outperforms other clipping libraries.\n",
