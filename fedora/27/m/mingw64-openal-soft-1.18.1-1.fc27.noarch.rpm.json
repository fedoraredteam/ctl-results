It's built off of the open-sourced Windows version available\noriginally from the SVN repository at openal.org. OpenAL provides\ncapabilities for playing audio in a virtual 3d environment. Distance\nattenuation, doppler shift, and directional sound emitters are among\nthe features handled by the API. More advanced effects, including air\nabsorption, low-pass filters, and reverb, are available through the\nEFX extension. It also facilitates streaming audio, multi-channel buffers,\nand audio capture.\n\nThis package provides the library for the Win64 target.\n",
