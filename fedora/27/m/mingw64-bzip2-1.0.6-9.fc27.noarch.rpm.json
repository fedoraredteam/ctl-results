However, bzip2 has the added benefit\nof being approximately two times faster at compression and six times\nfaster at decompression than those techniques.  Bzip2 is not the\nfastest compression utility, but it does strike a balance between speed\nand compression capability.\n\nThis package contains development tools and libraries for use when\ncross-compiling Windows software in Fedora.\n",
