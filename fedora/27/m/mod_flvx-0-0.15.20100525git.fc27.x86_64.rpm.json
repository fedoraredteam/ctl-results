            "Description": "\nFLV streaming means it can be sought to any position during video, and\nbrowser (Flash player) will buffer only from this position to the end.\nThus streaming allows to skip boring parts or see video ending without\nloading the whole file, which simply saves bandwidth. Even H264 is more\nefficient, FLV is still a common container format for videos, because\nH264 is supported by Flash since version 9.115.\n\nFor using FLV streaming on the web, a pseudo-streaming compliant Flash\nplayer, such as Flowplayer, is needed. Streaming requires that the FLV\nhas embedded key-frame markers (meta-data), that can be injected by any\nsupported tool, e.g. flvtool2.\n",
