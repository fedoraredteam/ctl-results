It can comfortably\nbe used for both desktop and web development, which was something\nI wanted from the beginning.\n\nMapnik is about making beautiful maps. It uses the AGG library\nand offers world class anti-aliasing rendering with subpixel\naccuracy for geographic data. It is written from scratch in\nmodern C++ and doesn't suffer from design decisions made a decade\nago. When it comes to handling common software tasks such as memory\nmanagement, filesystem access, regular expressions, parsing and so\non, Mapnik doesn't re-invent the wheel, but utilises best of breed\nindustry standard libraries from boost.org\n",
