Key features:\n\n\u00b0 Zero overhead Logging statements below a given level\n  can be automatically removed by javac at compile time.\n  This means applications can have detailed trace and\n  debug logging without having any impact on the finished product.\n\n\u00b0 Simple and efficient The API is concise and the code\n  is very efficient at run-time.\n\n\u00b0 Extremely lightweight The entire project consists of a single\n  Java file with ~100 non-comment lines of code.\n",
