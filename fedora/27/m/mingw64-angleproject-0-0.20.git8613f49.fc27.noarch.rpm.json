            "Description": "\nANGLE is a conformant implementation of the OpenGL ES 2.0 specification that\nis hardware\u2010accelerated via Direct3D. ANGLE v1.0.772 was certified compliant\nby passing the ES 2.0.3 conformance tests in October 2011. ANGLE also provides\nan implementation of the EGL 1.4 specification.\n\nANGLE is used as the default WebGL backend for both Google Chrome and\nMozilla Firefox on Windows platforms. Chrome uses ANGLE for all graphics\nrendering on Windows, including the accelerated Canvas2D implementation\nand the Native Client sandbox environment.\n\nPortions of the ANGLE shader compiler are used as a shader validator and\ntranslator by WebGL implementations across multiple platforms. It is used\non Mac OS X, Linux, and in mobile variants of the browsers. Having one shader\nvalidator helps to ensure that a consistent set of GLSL ES shaders are\naccepted across browsers and platforms. The shader translator can be used\nto translate shaders to other shading languages, and to optionally apply\nshader modifications to work around bugs or quirks in the native graphics\ndrivers. The translator targets Desktop GLSL, Direct3D HLSL, and even ESSL\nfor native GLES2 platforms.\n",
