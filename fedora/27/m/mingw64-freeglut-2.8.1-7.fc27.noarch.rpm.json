GLUT was originally written by Mark Kilgard to support the\nsample programs in the second edition OpenGL 'RedBook'. Since then,\nGLUT has been used in a wide variety of practical applications because\nit is simple, universally available and highly portable.\n\nfreeglut allows the user to create and manage windows containing\nOpenGL contexts on a wide range of platforms and also read the mouse,\nkeyboard and joystick functions.\n",
