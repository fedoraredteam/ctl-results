            "Description": "\nMiniz is a lossless, high performance data compression library in a single\nsource file that implements the zlib (RFC 1950) and Deflate (RFC 1951)\ncompressed data format specification standards. It supports the most commonly\nused functions exported by the zlib library, but is a completely independent\nimplementation so zlib's licensing requirements do not apply. It also\ncontains simple to use functions for writing PNG format image files and\nreading/writing/appending ZIP format archives. Miniz's compression speed has\nbeen tuned to be comparable to zlib's, and it also has a specialized real-time\ncompressor function designed to compare well against fastlz/minilzo.\n",
