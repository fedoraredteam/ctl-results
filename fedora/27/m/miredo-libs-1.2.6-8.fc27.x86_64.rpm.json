It can serve\neither as a Teredo client, a stand-alone Teredo relay, or a Teredo\nserver, please install the miredo-server or miredo-client appropriately.\nIt is meant to provide IPv6 connectivity to hosts behind NAT\ndevices, most of which do not support IPv6, and not even\nIPv6-over-IPv4 (including 6to4).\nThis libs package provides the files necessary for both server and client.\n",
