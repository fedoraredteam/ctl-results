            "Description": "\nXZ Utils are an attempt to make LZMA compression easy to use on free (as in\nfreedom) operating systems. This is achieved by providing tools and libraries\nwhich are similar to use than the equivalents of the most popular existing\ncompression algorithms.\n\nLZMA is a general purpose compression algorithm designed by Igor Pavlov as\npart of 7-Zip. It provides high compression ratio while keeping the\ndecompression speed fast.\n",
