MySQL++ relieves the programmer of dealing\nwith cumbersome C data structures, generation of repetitive SQL statements,\nand manual creation of C++ data structures to mirror the database schema.\n\nIf you are building your own MySQL++-based programs, you also need\nto install the -devel package.\n",
