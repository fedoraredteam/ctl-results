            "Description": "\nHTTPS Everywhere is a Firefox extension produced as a collaboration between\nThe Tor Project and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. It encrypts your\ncommunications with a number of major websites.\n\nMany sites on the web offer some limited support for encryption over HTTPS,\nbut make it difficult to use. For instance, they may default to unencrypted\nHTTP, or fill encrypted pages with links that go back to the unencrypted site.\n\nThe HTTPS Everywhere extension fixes these problems by rewriting all requests\nto these sites to HTTPS.\n",
