Basically, mailcap associates a particular type of file\nwith a particular program that a mail agent or other program can call\nin order to handle the file.  Mailcap should be installed to allow\ncertain programs to be able to handle non-text files.\n\nAlso included in this package is the mime.types file which contains a\nlist of MIME types and their filename \"extension\" associations, used\nby several applications e.g. to determine MIME types for filenames.\n",
