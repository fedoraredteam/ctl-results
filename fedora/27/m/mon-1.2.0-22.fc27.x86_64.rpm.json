            "Description": "\nMon is a general-purpose resource monitoring system.  It can be used\nto monitor network service availability, server problems,\nenvironmental conditions (i.e., the temperature in a room) or other\nthings. Mon can be used to test the condition and/or to trigger an\naction upon failure of the condition.  Mon keeps the testing and\naction-taking tasks as separate, stand-alone programs.\n\nMon is very extensible.  Monitors and alerts are not a part of mon, but\nthe distribution comes with a handful of them to get you started. This\nmeans that if a new service needs monitoring, or if a new alert is\nrequired, the mon server will not need to be changed.\n",
