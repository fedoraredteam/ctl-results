Originally\npart of the Gtk-- widget set, libsigc++ is now a separate library to\nprovide for more general use. It is the most complete library of its\nkind with the ability to connect an abstract callback to a class\nmethod, function, or function object. It contains adaptor classes for\nconnection of dissimilar callbacks and has an ease of use unmatched by\nother C++ callback libraries.\n\nPackage GTK-- (gtkmm), which is a C++ binding to the GTK+ library,\nstarting with version 1.1.2, uses libsigc++.\n",
