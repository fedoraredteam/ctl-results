            "Description": "\nMod_cluster is an httpd-based load balancer. Like mod_jk and mod_proxy,\nmod_cluster uses a communication channel to forward requests from httpd to one\nof a set of application server nodes. Unlike mod_jk and mod_proxy, mod_cluster\nleverages an additional connection between the application server nodes and\nhttpd. The application server nodes use this connection to transmit server-side\nload balance factors and lifecycle events back to httpd via a custom set of\nHTTP methods, affectionately called the Mod-Cluster Management Protocol (MCMP).\nThis additional feedback channel allows mod_cluster to offer a level of\nintelligence and granularity not found in other load balancing solutions.\n",
