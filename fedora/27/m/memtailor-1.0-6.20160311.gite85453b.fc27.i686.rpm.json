            "Description": "\nMemtailor is a C++ library of special purpose memory allocators.  It\ncurrently offers an arena allocator and a memory pool.\n\nThe main motivation to use a memtailor allocator is better and more\npredictable performance than you get with new/delete.  Sometimes a\nmemtailor allocator can also be more convenient due to the ability to\nfree many allocations at one time.\n\nThe Memtailor memory pool is useful if you need to do many allocations\nof a fixed size.  For example a memory pool is well suited to allocate\nthe nodes in a linked list.\n\nYou can think of the Memtailor arena allocator as being similar to stack\nallocation.  Both kinds of allocation are very fast and require you to\nallocate/deallocate memory in last-in-first-out order.  Arena allocation\nhas the further benefits that it stays within the C++ standard, it will\nnot cause a stack overflow, you can have multiple arena allocators at\nthe same time and allocation is not tied to a function invocation.\n",
