            "Description": "\nThe MyBatis data mapper framework makes it easier\nto use a relational database with object-oriented\napplications. MyBatis couples objects with stored\nprocedures or SQL statements using a XML descriptor\nor annotations. Simplicity is the biggest advantage\nof the MyBatis data mapper over object relational\nmapping tools.\n\nTo use the MyBatis data mapper, you rely on your\nown objects, XML, and SQL. There is little to\nlearn that you don't already know. With the\nMyBatis data mapper, you have the full power of\nboth SQL and stored procedures at your fingertips.\n\nThe MyBatis project is developed and maintained by\na team that includes the original creators of the\n\"iBATIS\" data mapper. The Apache project was retired\nand continued here.\n",
