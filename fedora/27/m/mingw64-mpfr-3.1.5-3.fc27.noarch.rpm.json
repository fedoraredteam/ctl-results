The MPFR is efficient and\nalso has a well-defined semantics. It copies the good ideas from the\nANSI/IEEE-754 standard for double-precision floating-point arithmetic\n(53-bit mantissa). MPFR is based on the GMP multiple-precision library.\n\nThis package contains cross-compiled libraries and development tools\nfor Windows.\n",
