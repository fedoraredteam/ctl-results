            "Description": "\nMOM is a policy-driven tool that can be used to manage overcommitment on KVM\nhosts. Using libvirt, MOM keeps track of active virtual machines on a host. At\na regular collection interval, data is gathered about the host and guests. Data\ncan come from multiple sources (eg. the /proc interface, libvirt API calls, a\nclient program connected to a guest, etc). Once collected, the data is\norganized for use by the policy evaluation engine. When started, MOM accepts a\nuser-supplied overcommitment policy. This policy is regularly evaluated using\nthe latest collected data. In response to certain conditions, the policy may\ntrigger reconfiguration of the system\u2019s overcommitment mechanisms. Currently\nMOM supports control of memory ballooning and KSM but the architecture is\ndesigned to accommodate new mechanisms such as cgroups.\n",
