            "Description": "\nMMDB is a macromolecular coordinate library, written by Eugene\nKrissinel primarily for use by the collaborative computational project\n4 (CCP4) group in the United Kingdom.  The Coordinate Library is\ndesigned to assist CCP4 developers in working with coordinate files.\n\nThe Library features work with the primary file formats of the Protein\nData Bank (PDB), the PDB file format and the mmCIF file format.\n\nThe Library provides various high-level tools for working with\ncoordinate files, which include not only reading and writing, but also\northogonal-fractional coordinate transforms, generation of symmetry\nmates, editing the molecular structure and some others. The Library is\nsupposed as a general low-level tool for unifying the\ncoordinate-related operations.\n\nThis package contains the shared library components needed for programs\nthat have been compiled with the mmdb library.\n",
