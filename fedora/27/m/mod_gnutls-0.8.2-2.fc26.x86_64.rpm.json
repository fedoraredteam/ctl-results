            "Description": "\nmod_gnutls uses the GnuTLS library to provide SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1\nencryption for Apache HTTPD.  It is similar to mod_ssl in purpose, but does\nnot use OpenSSL.  A primary benefit of using this module is the ability to\nconfigure multiple SSL certificates for a single IP-address/port combination\n(useful for securing virtual hosts).\n\nFeatures\n    * Support for SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1.\n    * Support for client certificates.\n    * Support for RFC 5081 OpenPGP certificate authentication.\n    * Support for Server Name Indication.\n    * Distributed SSL Session Cache via Memcached\n    * Local SSL Session Cache using DBM\n    * Sets enviromental vars for scripts (compatible with mod_ssl vars)\n    * Small and focused code base:\n         Lines of code in mod_gnutls: 3,593\n         Lines of code in mod_ssl: 15,324\n",
