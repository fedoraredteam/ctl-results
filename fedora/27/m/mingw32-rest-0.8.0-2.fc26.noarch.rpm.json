            "Description": "\nThis library was designed to make it easier to access web services that\nclaim to be \"RESTful\". A RESTful service should have urls that represent\nremote objects, which methods can then be called on. The majority of services\ndon't actually adhere to this strict definition. Instead, their RESTful end\npoint usually has an API that is just simpler to use compared to other types\nof APIs they may support (XML-RPC, for instance). It is this kind of API that\nthis library is attempting to support.\n",
