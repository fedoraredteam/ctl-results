            "Description": "\nArchetype is a Maven project templating toolkit. An archetype is\ndefined as an original pattern or model from which all other things of\nthe same kind are made. The names fits as we are trying to provide a\nsystem that provides a consistent means of generating Maven\nprojects. Archetype will help authors create Maven project templates\nfor users, and provides users with the means to generate parameterized\nversions of those project templates.\n\nUsing archetypes provides a great way to enable developers quickly in\na way consistent with best practices employed by your project or\norganization. Within the Maven project we use archetypes to try and\nget our users up and running as quickly as possible by providing a\nsample project that demonstrates many of the features of Maven while\nintroducing new users to the best practices employed by Maven. In a\nmatter of seconds a new user can have a working Maven project to use\nas a jumping board for investigating more of the features in Maven. We\nhave also tried to make the Archetype mechanism additive and by that\nwe mean allowing portions of a project to be captured in an archetype\nso that pieces or aspects of a project can be added to existing\nprojects. A good example of this is the Maven site archetype. If, for\nexample, you have used the quick start archetype to generate a working\nproject you can then quickly create a site for that project by using\nthe site archetype within that existing project. You can do anything\nlike this with archetypes.\n\nYou may want to standardize J2EE development within your organization\nso you may want to provide archetypes for EJBs, or WARs, or for your\nweb services. Once these archetypes are created and deployed in your\norganization's repository they are available for use by all developers\nwithin your organization.\n",
