MALOC is used as the foundation layer\nfor a number of scientific applications, including MC, SG, and\nAPBS. MALOC can be used as a small stand-alone abstraction environment\nfor writing portable C programs which need access to resources which\nare typically architecture-dependent, such as INET sockets, timing\nroutines, and so on. MALOC provides abstract datatypes, memory\nmanagement routines, timing routines, machine epsilon, access to UNIX\nand INET sockets, MPI, and so on. All things that can vary from one\narchitecture to another are abstracted out of an application code and\nplaced in MALOC.\n",
