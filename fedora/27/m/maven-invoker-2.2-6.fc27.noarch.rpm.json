It accomplishes\nits task by building up a conventional Maven command line from options given in\nthe current request, along with those global options specified in the invoker\nitself. Once it has the command line, the invoker will execute it, and capture\nthe resulting exit code or any exception thrown to signal a failure to execute.\nInput/output control can be specified using an InputStream and up to two\nInvocationOutputHandlers.\n\nThis is a replacement package for maven-shared-invoker\n",
