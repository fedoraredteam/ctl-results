            "Description": "\nMunin is a highly flexible and powerful solution used to create graphs\nof virtually everything imaginable throughout your network, while still\nmaintaining a rattling ease of installation and configuration.\n\nThis package contains node software. You should install it on all the nodes\nin your network. It will know how to extract all sorts of data from the\nnode it runs on, and will wait for the gatherer to request this data for\nfurther processing.\n\nIt includes a range of plugins capable of extracting common values such as\ncpu usage, network usage, load average, and so on. Creating your own plugins\nwhich are capable of extracting other system-specific values is very easy,\nand is often done in a matter of minutes. You can also create plugins which\nrelay information from other devices in your network that can't run Munin,\nsuch as a switch or a server running another operating system, by using SNMP\nor similar technology.\n\nMunin is written in Perl, and relies heavily on Tobi Oetiker's excellent\nRRDtool.\n",
