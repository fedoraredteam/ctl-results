            "Description": "\nCoda Hale's Metrics package makes it easy to create useful metrics so you\nknow what is going on in production. In addition to showing up in the\nnormal Java places (JMX), Metrics supports an arbitrary number of Reporters\n(where to send the application telemetry to make pretty graphs).\nGanglia and Graphite (or both) are among the most popular choices.\n\nHowever, Metrics purposefully doesn't come with a kitchen sink of support for\nevery dependency injection or configuration tool yet devised by Java\ndevelopers. Metrics-Reporter-Config aims to provide a simple way to configure\nand enable a set of Reporters that can be shared among applications. It\nshould fit most (say 90% of) use cases and avoid situations like a plethora\nof subtly incompatible properties files.\n",
