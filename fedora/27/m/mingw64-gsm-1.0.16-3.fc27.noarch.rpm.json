            "Description": "\nContains runtime shared libraries for libgsm, an implementation of\nthe European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for full-rate speech\ntranscoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP (residual pulse\nexcitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.\n\nGSM 06.10 compresses frames of 162 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling\nrate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility\nwith typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160\n16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).\nThe quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker\nrecognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable\nform (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).\n\nThe interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and\na library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime\non most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the\nETSI standard test patterns.\n\nThis package is MinGW compiled gsm library for the Win64 target.\n",
