This means that you'll not find yet\nanother string class or list implementation and that you'll feel comfortable\nin using this library from the very first time.\n\nMost classes functionalities and behavior will be clear if you ever studied\nMIME and its components; if you don't know anything about Internet messages\nyou'll probably want to read some RFCs to understand the topic and, therefore,\neasily use the library whose names, whenever possible, overlap terms adopted\nin the standard RFC documents. At the very least: RFC 822, RFC 2045 and RFC\n2046.\n",
