On the other hand no assumption is made on the model, you can\nwork on any problem type: timetabling, assignment problems, vehicle routing,\nbin-packing and so on.\n\nOnce you have implemented your model in the problem framework, the library\nmakes easy testing different Tabu Search strategies or even different\nalgorithms (Simulated Annealing or other local search based algorithms) with\na few lines of code.\n",
