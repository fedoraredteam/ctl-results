Characters that could be mistaken for one another (O, 0, I, l, 1,\netc.) have distinct shapes to make them easier to tell apart in the context of\nsource code.\n\nIt has support for most Western and European Latin-based languages, Greek, and\nCyrillic. It also includes special \u201cbox drawing\u201d characters.\n\nAnonymous Pro is based on an earlier font, Anonymous, which is a TrueType\nversion of Susan Lesch and David Lamkins\u2019 font Anonymous 9, a freeware\nMacintosh bitmap font.\n\nIt was created by Mark Simonson.\n",
