            "Description": "\nMhash is a free library which provides a uniform interface to a\nlarge number of hash algorithms.\n\nThese algorithms can be used to compute checksums, message digests,\nand other signatures. The HMAC support implements the basics for\nmessage authentication, following RFC 2104. In the later versions\nsome key generation algorithms, which use hash algorithms, have been\nadded. Currently, the library supports the algorithms: ADLER32, GOST,\nHAVAL256, HAVAL224, HAVAL192, HAVAL160, HAVAL128, MD5, MD4, MD2,\nRIPEMD128/160/256/320, TIGER, TIGER160, TIGER128, SHA1/224/256/384/512,\nWhirlpool, SNEFRU128/256, CRC32B and CRC32 checksums.\n",
