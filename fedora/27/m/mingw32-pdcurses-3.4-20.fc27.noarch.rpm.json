            "Description": "\nPDCurses is a public domain curses library for DOS, OS/2, Win32, X11\nand SDL, implementing most of the functions available in X/Open and\nSystem V R4 curses. It supports many compilers for these\nplatforms. The X11 port lets you recompile existing text-mode curses\nprograms to produce native X11 applications.\n\nNote that ncurses is not available for MinGW / Windows.  Applications\nwhich need curses functionality can use this package, provided they\ndon't use any of the extensions specific to ncurses.\n",
