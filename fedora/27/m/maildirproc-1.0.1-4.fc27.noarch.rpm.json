It is primarily focused on mail sorting, which means\nmoving, copying, forwarding, and deleting mail according to a set of rules.\nIt can be seen as an alternative to procmail, but instead of being a delivery\nagent (which wants to be part of the delivery chain), maildirproc only\nprocesses mail which has already been delivered. That is a feature, not a bug.\n",
