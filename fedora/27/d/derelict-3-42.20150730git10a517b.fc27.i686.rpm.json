            "Description": "\nderelict supports some useful features for project development, including:\n- Cross-Platform Consistency\nderelict loads shared libraries manually at run-time and throws an exception\nwhen the library, or any symbol in the library, fails to load. This gives you\ncomplete control over how to handle the case of a missing shared library. You\ncan fall back to a different code path, give your users a helpful error message\nor take any action you want. Regardless, you have consistent behavior across\nmultiple platforms.\n- Selective Symbol Loading - This feature allows you to override exceptions\nthrown by derelict when a shared library symbol fails to load. It is a goal of\nthe project that each derelict package be updated from time-to-time to load the\nlatest version of each library. Often, new library versions include new\nfunctions. If a user has an older version of the library installed, one that is\nmissing the new function symbols, derelict will notice and throw an exception.\nBy making use of Selective Symbol Loading, you can override this behavior and\nallow the older library version to load successfully.\n",
