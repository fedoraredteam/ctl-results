It is\nintended to bring a native, full-featured client to Linux GTK+ desktop\nenvironments such as GNOME and XFCE. It supports features such as DHT\n(Distributed Hash Tables), PEX (\u00b5Torrent-compatible Peer Exchange), and UPnP\n(Universal Plug-n-Play) that allow one to more easily share BitTorrent data\neven from behind a router with virtually zero configuration of port-forwarding.\n",
