            "Description": "\nD-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to\ntalk to one another. In addition to interprocess communication,\nD-Bus helps coordinate process lifecycle; it makes it simple and\nreliable to code a \"single instance\" application or daemon, and to\nlaunch applications and daemons on demand when their services are\nneeded.\n\nThis is a complete independent implementation of the D-Bus protocol\nin Java. It comprises a library to write programs in Java which\naccess D-Bus, a tool for generating stubs from D-Bus introspection\ndata and a simple daemon. Being written in Java it works on both\nWindows and Linux (and other Unix-like systems).\n\nWhen using a TCP transport it is entirely Java-based; when using\nUnix-sockets it requires a small JNI library to use Unix-Sockets.\n",
