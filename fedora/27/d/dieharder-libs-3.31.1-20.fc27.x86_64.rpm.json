            "Description": "\n\nlibdieharder is the core library of dieharder designed to be \"the last\nsuite of random number testers you'll ever wear\".  It can test any of\nits many pre-built and library linked generators (basically all of those\nin the Gnu Scientific Library plus a number of others from various\nsources) or a potentially random data-set in either an ASCII-formatted\nor raw (presumed 32 bit unsigned int) binary file.  It is fairly\nstraightforward to wrap new software generators for testing, or to add\nhardware generators that have a software interface for testing, and the\nfile input method permits pretty much any software or hardware RNG to be\ntested using libdieharder calls.\n\nlibdieharder has as a design goal the full encapsulation in an\nextensible shell of basically all the random number tests: George\nMarsaglia's \"Diehard\" battery of tests, STS (v1.6) from NIST FIPS,\nKnuth's tests, and more.  Check the documentation for complete list.\n",
