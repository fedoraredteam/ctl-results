You can think of each context as representing a \"section\"\nof your site. For each context, you can choose the conditions that trigger this\ncontext to be active and choose different aspects of Drupal that should react to\nthis active context.\n\nThink of conditions as a set of rules that are checked during page load to see\nwhat context is active. Any reactions that are associated with active contexts\nare then fired.\n\nThis package provides the following Drupal modules:\n* context\n* context_layouts\n* context_ui\n",
