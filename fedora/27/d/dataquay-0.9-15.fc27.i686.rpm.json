            "Description": "\nDataquay is a free open source library that provides a friendly C++\ninterface to an RDF datastore using Qt4 classes and\ncontainers. Supported datastores are the popular and feature-complete\nRedland and the lightweight Sord.\n\nDataquay is simple to use and easy to integrate. It is principally\naimed at Qt-based applications that would like to use an RDF datastore\nas backing for in-memory project data, to avoid having to invent file\nformats or XML schemas and to make it easy to augment the data with\ndescriptive metadata pulled in from external sources. It's also useful\nfor applications with ad-hoc needs for metadata management using RDF\nsources.\n\nDataquay does not use a separate database, instead using in-memory\nstorage with separate file import and export facilities. Although it\noffers a choice of datastore implementations, the choice is made at\ncompile time: there is no runtime module system to take into account\nwhen deploying your application.\n\nThe Fedora package is configured to use Redland, as recommended by the\ndevelopers for general use.\n",
