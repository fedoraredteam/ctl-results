            "Description": "\nDstat is a versatile replacement for vmstat, iostat, netstat and ifstat.\nDstat overcomes some of their limitations and adds some extra features,\nmore counters and flexibility. Dstat is handy for monitoring systems\nduring performance tuning tests, benchmarks or troubleshooting.\n\nDstat allows you to view all of your system resources instantly, you\ncan eg. compare disk usage in combination with interrupts from your\nIDE controller, or compare the network bandwidth numbers directly\nwith the disk throughput (in the same interval).\n\nDstat gives you detailed selective information in columns and clearly\nindicates in what magnitude and unit the output is displayed. Less\nconfusion, less mistakes.\n",
