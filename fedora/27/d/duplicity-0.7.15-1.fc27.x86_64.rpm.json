            "Description": "\nDuplicity incrementally backs up files and directory by encrypting\ntar-format volumes with GnuPG and uploading them to a remote (or\nlocal) file server. In theory many protocols for connecting to a\nfile server could be supported; so far ssh/scp, local file access,\nrsync, ftp, HSI, WebDAV and Amazon S3 have been written.\n\nBecause duplicity uses librsync, the incremental archives are space\nefficient and only record the parts of files that have changed since\nthe last backup. Currently duplicity supports deleted files, full\nunix permissions, directories, symbolic links, fifos, device files,\nbut not hard links.\n",
