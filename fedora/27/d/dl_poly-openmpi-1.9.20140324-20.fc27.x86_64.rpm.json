            "Description": "\n\nDL_POLY Classic is a general purpose molecular dynamics simulation\npackage developed at Daresbury Laboratory by W. Smith, T.R. Forester\nand I.T. Todorov.  It is based on the package DL_POLY_2, which was\noriginally developed by the Computational Chemistry Group, (CCG) at\nDaresbury Laboratory under the auspices of the Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) for (CCP5), the EPSRC's\nCollaborative Computational Project for the Computer Simulation of\nCondensed Phases.\n\nDL_POLY Classic can be executed as a serial or a parallel application.\nThe code achieves parallelisation using the Replicated Data strategy\nwhich is suitable for homogeneous, distributed-memory, parallel\ncomputers.  The code is useful for simulations of up to 30,000 atoms\nwith good parallel performance on up to 100 processors, though in some\ncircumstances it can exceed or fail to reach these limits.\n\nReference: I.T. Todorov, W. Smith, K. Trachenko & M.T. Dove,\nJournal of Materials Chemistry, (2006) 16, 1911-1918\n\nThis is a parallel version using openmpi.\n",
