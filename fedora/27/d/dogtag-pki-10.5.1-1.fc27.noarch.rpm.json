            "Description": "\nThe Dogtag Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Suite is comprised of the following\nfive subsystems and a client (for use by a Token Management System):\n\n  * Certificate Authority (CA)\n  * Key Recovery Authority (KRA)\n  * Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Manager\n  * Token Key Service (TKS)\n  * Token Processing System (TPS)\n  * Enterprise Security Client (ESC)\n\nAdditionally, it provides a console GUI application used for server and\nuser/group administration of CA, KRA, OCSP, and TKS, as well as various\ncommand-line tools used to assist with a PKI deployment.\n\nTo successfully deploy instances of a CA, KRA, OCSP, TKS, or TPS,\na Tomcat Web Server must be up and running locally on this machine.\n\nTo meet the database storage requirements of each CA, KRA, OCSP, TKS, or TPS\ninstance, a 389 Directory Server must be up and running either locally on\nthis machine, or remotely over the attached network connection.\n\nFinally, although they are no longer supplied by this 'meta' package,\njavadocs are available for both JSS (jss-javadoc) and portions of\nthe Dogtag PKI API (pki-javadoc).\n\nNOTE:  As a convenience for standalone deployments, this 'dogtag-pki'\n       top-level meta package supplies Dogtag themes for use by the\n       certificate server packages:\n\n         * dogtag-pki-theme (Dogtag Certificate System deployments)\n           * dogtag-pki-server-theme\n           * dogtag-pki-console-theme\n",
