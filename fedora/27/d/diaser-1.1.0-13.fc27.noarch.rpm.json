A quick and low-cost way to make an environment more\nrobust and data more accessible by archiving in multiple places. This\nreplication also provides fast retrieval of archived data from all node\nhosting locations. A Perl installer creates the system. Nodes can be dedicated\nto storage or used for existing services over unused bandwidth. DIASER works\nin user space over SSH. The software is based on DIAP/LTASP which is a storage\narchitecture designed to structure months to years of long term sustainable\narchiving space including retrospective archiving.\n",
