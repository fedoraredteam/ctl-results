This tool aims to do everything\nthat can be mechanized, and to preserve any troff-level information that might\nhave structural implications in XML comments.\n\nThis tool does the hard parts.  TBL tables are translated into DocBook\ntable markup, PIC into SVG, and EQN into MathML (relying on pic2svg\nand GNU eqn for the last two).\n",
