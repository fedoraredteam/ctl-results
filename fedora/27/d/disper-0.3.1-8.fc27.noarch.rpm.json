It is intended to be used just\nbefore giving a presentation with a laptop, when all one wants is that the\nbeamer, which has just been connected, is able to show whatever you prepared.\n\nDisper gives you the option to either clone all detected displays, or extend\nthe desktop to them. Resolutions are automatically detected. For cloning, the\nhighest common resolution supported by all displays is chosen; for extending\nevery display device gets its highest supported resolution. For special setups\nrequiring more detailed control, one can still use the standard display\nconfiguration utilities.\n\nAt the moment nVidia cards are supported, and a basic XRandR backend is in\nplace.\n",
