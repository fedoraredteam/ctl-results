            "Description": "\nThis package contains the German language version of dreamweb, a\nclick-and-point adventure with the look and feel of Ridley Scott's\nBlade Runner.\n\n\nRyan, a bartender from a dystopian future can't sleep peacefully\nfor months.  His nights are sequences of nightmares and strange\ndreams, days with frequent black-outs with strange visions, until\none night a figure in monk attire appears to him, and tells him the\nstory of the seven evil ones, uniting to destroy to Dreamweb, the\nonly barrier between the world and darkness.  The monk makes a\nproposition:  Ryan becomes the \"deliverer\":  the one who would keep\nthe Dreamweb safe by killing those who try to destroy it.\n\nDescending into paranoia and just wanting dreams to stop, Ryan\naccepts the mission, then wakes up in a puddle of cold sweat, next\nto his beloved girlfriend in her house, and late for work.  Again.\n\nDreamWeb is a top-down adventure game set in a gritty futuristic\ndystopian city.  Each location takes only a small portion of the\nscreen without panning (except an optional small zoom window in the\ncorner that follows the cursor), with the player interacting with\nobjects and people by simply clicking them.  Ryan has a limited\ninventory space, and as a lot of objects can be picked up (many\nwithout any use), the player must rationalize what might be useful\nand what just serves as filler.\n\nDialogue is straightforward, with no options, but still required\nto advance in the game (to find new locations, for instance).  In\nsituations where many adventure games usually feature an indirect\napproach to solve a problem, Ryan often faces himself with\nsituations where it's \"killed or be killed\", which result in deaths\n(sometimes of innocents).\n",
