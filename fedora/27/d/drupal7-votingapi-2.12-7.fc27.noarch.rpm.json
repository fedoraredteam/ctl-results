            "Description": "\nVotingAPI helps developers who want to use a standardized API and schema for\nstoring, retrieving, and tabulating votes for Drupal content.\n\nAmong other things, it supports:\n* Rating of any content (comments, nodes, users, fish, whatever)\n* Multi-criteria voting (rate a game based on video, audio, and replayability)\n* Automatic tabulation of results (with support for different voting styles,\n  like 'percentage' and '+1/-1')\n* Efficient caching of results (sorting and filtering doesn't require any\n  recalculation)\n* Hooks for additional vote calculations\n\nNote that this module does NOT directly expose any voting mechanisms to end\nusers. It's a framework designed to make life easier for other developers,\nand to standardize voting data for consumption by other modules (like Views).\n\nFor some examples of simple voting systems based on VotingAPI, check\nIs Useful [1], Fivestar [2], and Plus1 [3].\n\nThis package provides the following Drupal module:\n* votingapi\n\n[1] http://drupal.org/project/is_useful\n[2] http://drupal.org/project/fivestar\n[3] http://drupal.org/project/plus1\n",
