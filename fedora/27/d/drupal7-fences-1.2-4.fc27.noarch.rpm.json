This\nelement choice will propagate everywhere the field is used, such as teasers, RSS\nfeeds and Views. You don't have to keep re-configuring the same HTML element\nover and over again every time you display the field.\n\nBest of all, Fences provides leaner markup than Drupal 7 core! And can get rid\nof the extraneous classes too!\n\nThis kind of tool is needed in order to create semantic HTML5 output from\nDrupal. Without such a tool, you have to create custom field templates in your\ntheme for every field. :(\n\nSimilar projects include Semantic fields [1], Field Wrappers [2] and a tool\ninside the Display Suite [3] extras.\n\nThis package provides the following Drupal module:\n* fences\n\n[1] http://drupal.org/project/semantic_fields\n[2] http://drupal.org/project/field_wrappers\n[3] http://drupal.org/project/ds\n",
