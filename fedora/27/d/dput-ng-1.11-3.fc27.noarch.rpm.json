It allows\nanyone who works with Debian packages to upload their work to a remote\nservice, including Debian's ftp-master, mentors.debian.net, Launchpad or other\npackage hosting facilities for Debian package maintainers.\n\ndput-ng features many enhancements over dput, such as more comprehensive\nchecks, an easy to use plugin system, and code designed to handle the numerous\narchives that any Debian package hacker will interact with.\n\ndput-ng aims to be backwards compatible with dput in command-line flags,\nconfiguration files, and expected behavior.\n",
