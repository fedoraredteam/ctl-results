            "Description": "\nCrumbs is a powerful breadcrumb-building machine, generating high-quality\nbreadcrumbs for most every page on your site, with minimal configuration.\n\nThe Crumbs engine takes advantage of the hierarchical nature inherent to\nbreadcrumbs: It calculates the parent of the current page, the parent of\nthe parent, etc, until it has the complete breadcrumb trail.\n\nCrumbs uses plugins with fine-grained user-defined priorities, for each\nstep in this process. Plugins for most of your favorite modules are already\nbuilt-in, and you can add more.\n\nA lot of stuff that would require laborious configuration with other\nbreadcrumb-building modules, does work out of the box with Crumbs. And if it\ndoesn't, there are powerful and ways to configure, customize and extend.\n\nWhere in other breadcrumb-customizing modules you need to define complete\nbreadcrumbs for various pages and their all their children, in Crumbs you\nmostly just say \"A is the parent of B\", and it can solve all the rest of\nthe puzzle by itself.\n\nThis package provides the following Drupal modules:\n* crumbs\n* crumbs_example (requires manual install of xautoload)\n* crumbs_labs\n",
