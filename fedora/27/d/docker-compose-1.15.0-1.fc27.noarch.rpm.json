            "Description": "\nCompose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker\napplications. With Compose, you use a Compose file to configure your\napplication's services. Then, using a single command, you create and\nstart all the services from your configuration.\n\nCompose is great for development, testing, and staging environments,\nas well as CI workflows.\n\nUsing Compose is basically a three-step process.\n\n1. Define your app's environment with a Dockerfile so it can be\n   reproduced anywhere.\n2. Define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so\n   they can be run together in an isolated environment:\n3. Lastly, run docker-compose up and Compose will start and run your\n   entire app.\n",
