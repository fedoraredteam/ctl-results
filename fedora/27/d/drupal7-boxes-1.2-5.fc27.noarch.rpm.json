            "Description": "\nBoxes module is a re-implementation of the custom blocks (boxes) that the core\nblock module provides. It is a proof of concept for what a re-worked block\nmodule could do.\n\nThe module assumes that custom blocks are configuration, and not content. This\nmeans that it is a reasonable action to ask for all blocks at one time, this is\nin fact exactly what the core block module does.\n\nBoxes provides an inline interface for editing blocks, allowing you to change\nthe contents of blocks without going to an admin page.\n\nBoxes provides exportables for its blocks via the (required) Chaos tools module.\nThis allows modules to provide blocks in code that can be overwritten in the UI.\n\nThis package provides the following Drupal module:\n* boxes\n",
