            "Description": "\n\nKLT is an implementation, in the C programming language, of a\nfeature tracker for the computer vision community.  The source\ncode is in the public domain, available for both commercial and\nnon-commercial use.\n\nThe tracker is based on the early work of Lucas and Kanade,\nwas developed fully by Tomasi and Kanade, and was explained clearly\nin the paper by Shi and Tomasi. Later, Tomasi proposed a slight\nmodification which makes the computation symmetric with respect\nto the two images -- the resulting equation is derived in the\nunpublished note by myself.  Briefly, good features are located\nby examining the minimum eigenvalue of each 2 by 2 gradient\nmatrix, and features are tracked using a Newton-Raphson method of\nminimizing the difference between the two windows. Multi-resolution\ntracking allows for relatively large displacements between images.\nThe affine computation that evaluates the consistency of features\nbetween non-consecutive frames was implemented by Thorsten\nThormaehlen several years after the original code and documentation\nwere written.\n",
