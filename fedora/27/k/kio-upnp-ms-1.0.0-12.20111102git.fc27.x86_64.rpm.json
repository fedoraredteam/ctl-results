It supports both\nbrowse and search based MediaServers and is able to perform various tasks on\nthem, including running queries, listing directories and files and allowing\nKDE based applications transparent access to them. Being used for Amarok UPnP\nsupport, the slave features many developer friendly features which allow\nfaster speed or easier handling while compromising on user-friendliness when\nused \u201cunder the hood\u201d.\n\nFunctionality requires some user-intervention to re-enable the SOLID_UPNP\nbackend, which is disabled in fedora by default due to many crashes\n( see https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=259472 ).  To re-enable, set\nSOLID_UPNP=1 environment variable, or copy the sample SOLID_UPNP.sh to\n$HOME/.kde/env/\nto do it for you.\n",
