            "Description": "\n\nWenQuanYi Zen Hei is a Hei-Ti style (sans-serif type) Chinese\noutline font. It is designed for general purpose text formatting\nand on-screen display of Chinese characters and symbols from\nmany other languages. The embolden strokes of the font glyphs\nproduces enhanced screen contrast, making it easier to read\nrecognize. The embedded bitmap glyphs further enhance on-screen\nperformance, which can be enabled with the provided configuration\nfiles. WenQuanYi Zen Hei provides a rather complete coverage to\nChinese Hanzi glyphs, including both simplified and traditional\nforms. The total glyph number in this font is over 35,000, including\nover 21,000 Chinese Hanzi. This font has full coverage to GBK(CP936)\ncharset, CJK Unified Ideographs, as well as the code-points\nneeded for zh_cn, zh_sg, zh_tw, zh_hk, zh_mo, ja (Japanese)\nand ko (Korean) locales for fontconfig. Starting from version\n0.8, this font package has contained two font families, i.e.\nthe proportionally-spaced Zen Hei, and a mono-spaced face\nnamed \"WenQuanYi Zen Hei Mono\".\n",
