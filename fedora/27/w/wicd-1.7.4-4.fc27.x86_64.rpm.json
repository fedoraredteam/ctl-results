Every network, both wired and wireless, has its\nown profile with its own configuration options and connection behavior.\nWicd will try to automatically connect only to networks the user specifies\nit should try, with a preference first to a wired network, then to wireless.\n\nThis package provides the architecture-dependent components of wicd.\n",
