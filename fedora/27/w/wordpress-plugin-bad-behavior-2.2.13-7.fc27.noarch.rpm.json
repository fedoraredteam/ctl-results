            "Description": "\nBad Behavior is a PHP-based solution for blocking link spam and the robots\nwhich deliver it.\n\nBad Behavior complements other link spam solutions by acting as a gatekeeper,\npreventing spammers from ever delivering their junk, and in many cases, from\never reading your site in the first place. This keeps your site's load down,\nmakes your site logs cleaner, and can help prevent denial of service conditions\ncaused by spammers.\n\nBad Behavior also transcends other link spam solutions by working in a\ncompletely different, unique way. Instead of merely looking at the content of\npotential spam, Bad Behavior analyzes the delivery method as well as the\nsoftware the spammer is using. In this way, Bad Behavior can stop spam attacks\neven when nobody has ever seen the particular spam before.\n\nBad Behavior is designed to work alongside existing spam prevention services to\nincrease their effectiveness and efficiency. Whenever possible, you should run\nit in combination with a more traditional spam prevention service.\n\nThis package is built for use with WordPress (wordpress), not WordPress MU.\n",
