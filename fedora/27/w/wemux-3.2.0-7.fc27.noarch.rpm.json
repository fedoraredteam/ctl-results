It allows users to host a wemux server and have clients join\nin either:\n\n**Mirror Mode** gives clients (another SSH user on your machine) read-only\naccess to the session, allowing them to see you work, or\n\n**Pair Mode** allows the client and yourself to work in the same terminal\n(shared cursor)\n\n**Rogue Mode** allows the client to pair or work independently in another\nwindow (separate cursors) in the same tmux session.\n\nIt features multi-server support as well as user listing\nand notifications when users attach/detach.\n",
