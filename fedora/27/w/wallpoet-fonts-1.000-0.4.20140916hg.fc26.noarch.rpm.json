            "Description": "\nWallpoet is inspired by the often political, short, sometimes provocative,\nsometimes funny or both, messages found on city walls, sprayed by some anonymous\nagent. Words, images or both!\n\nThe idea behind the font is making a font with a bit of punch, but still easy to\nuse for template graffiti. Print, cut & spray - being the key concept. That's\nwhy it has no curves and off course is a stencil font.\n\nWith the font, Lars wants to pay respect to the urban guerilla scene, which has\ninspired him so often with it's total disrespect for the traditional and\ningenious ability to break out of the traditional box.\n",
