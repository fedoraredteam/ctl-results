            "Description": "\n\nRsolid is an R package for normalizing fluorescent intensity data from\nABI/SOLiD second generation sequencing platform. It has been observed\nthat the color-calls provided by factory software contain technical\nartifacts, where the proportions of colors called are extremely\nvariable across sequencing cycles. Under the random DNA fragmentation\nassumption, these proportions should be equal across sequencing cycles\nand proportional to the dinucleotide frequencies of the sample.\n\nRsolid implements a version of the quantile normalization algorithm\nthat transforms the intensity values before calling colors. Results\nshow that after normalization, the total number of mappable reads\nincreases by around 5%, and number of perfectly mapped reads increases\nby 10%. Moreover a 2-5% reduction in overall error rates is observed,\nwith a 2-6% reduction in the rate of valid adjacent color\nmis-matches. The latter is important, since it leads to a decrease in\nfalse-positive SNP calls.\n\nThe normalization algorithm is computationally efficient. In a test we\nare able to process 300 million reads in 2 hours using 10 computer\ncluster nodes. The engine functions of the package are written in C\nfor better performance.\n",
