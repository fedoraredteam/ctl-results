            "Description": "\nJudy is a C library that provides a state-of-the-art core technology\nthat implements a sparse dynamic array. Judy arrays are declared\nsimply with a null pointer. A Judy array consumes memory only when it\nis populated, yet can grow to take advantage of all available memory\nif desired. Judy's key benefits are scalability, high performance, and\nmemory efficiency. A Judy array is extensible and can scale up to a\nvery large number of elements, bounded only by machine memory. Since\nJudy is designed as an unbounded array, the size of a Judy array is\nnot pre-allocated but grows and shrinks dynamically with the array\npopulation.\n",
