            "Description": "\nCmockery tests are compiled into a stand-alone executable and linked\nwith the cmockery library, the standard C library and module being\ntested. Any symbols external to the module being tested should be\nmocked - replaced with functions that return values determined by\nthe test - within the test application. Even though significant\ndifferences may exist between the target execution environment of a\ncode module and the environment used to test the code the unit\ntesting is still valid since its goal is to test the logic of a\ncode modules at a functional level and not necessarily all of its\ninteractions with the target execution environment.\n\nOther features:\n* Lightweight C Unit test with mocking support\n* JUnit XML report output which can be used with Jenkins\n* Provides design-by-contract support\n\nThis project is a successor of http://code.google.com/p/cmockery-staging/\nwhich is a successor of Google's http://code.google.com/p/cmockery/.\n",
